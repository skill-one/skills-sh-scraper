"""Bridge to the ttscn component skill — the single synthesis engine.

Every BACKENDS id routes here with config['platform'] set. Chunks are sent
RAW (expressiveness markers intact): ttscn owns per-platform rendering of
[PAUSE:x] / sound tags and phoneme application (--phonemes). Each chunk is
one `tts.py` invocation (ttscn sub-chunks internally per provider limits),
then normalized to the suite's 48 kHz mono WAV.

Word boundaries: when ttscn returns data.word_boundaries (platforms with
native boundary events: edge, azure, doubao, minimax, cosyvoice), each
offset_sec — absolute within that invocation's file — is shifted by the
accumulated duration of prior chunks, and non-spoken script characters
(punctuation) are reinserted between word tokens
(_merge_native_boundaries) because srt.py and section matching rely on
them. Otherwise (and for resume-skipped parts) boundaries are estimated
by distributing the measured chunk duration across visible characters.
Keep registry max_chars small (400): estimation error is bounded by chunk
length, and chunk durations themselves are always measured.

Contract: the bridge consumes ttscn's JSON envelope (ok/data/error plus
meta.schema_version, a semver string; the major bumps on breaking envelope
changes). A present schema_version must match SUPPORTED_SCHEMA_MAJOR —
checked on success and error envelopes alike, since an incompatible-schema
error envelope can't be trusted either. Envelopes without schema_version
come from pre-contract ttscn releases (the known-good baseline vpm 4.x/5.0
was written against) and are accepted.

config keys: entry (tts.py path), platform, voice, speech_rate, phonemes_path,
style (azure only — injected as TTS_STYLE into the subprocess env).
