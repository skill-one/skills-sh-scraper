# Arize Instrumentation Skill

Add **Arize AX tracing** to an app for the first time: **detect the stack → fetch the one matching integration doc → wire auto-instrumentation → verify a trace lands.**

**Route locally.** Map the detected stack to a single doc page via [references/integration-routing.md](references/integration-routing.md) (exhaustive for tracing integrations) and fetch **only that page**. When the app uses an agent framework, route on the **framework**, not the provider SDK it wraps — a bare `openai`/`anthropic` import inside a framework app is not the integration target; route to a provider page only when the app calls the provider SDK directly with no framework in play. If the stack isn't listed there, it has no dedicated integration — use [manual instrumentation](https://arize.com/docs/ax/instrument/manual-instrumentation). Never bulk-fetch the [PROMPT.md](https://arize.com/docs/PROMPT.md)/[llms.txt](https://arize.com/docs/llms.txt) aggregates.

**Rules:** inspect before mutating; tracing is additive, never change business logic; follow existing style; no secrets in code and **never ask the user to paste secrets (API keys, tokens) into the chat** -- reference `ARIZE_API_KEY`/`ARIZE_SPACE_ID` env vars only, set by the user in their own `.env`/shell; preserve or ask for the app's Arize region/export endpoint instead of assuming US -- see [references/regions-and-endpoints.md](references/regions-and-endpoints.md); ask before persistent local state (`ax` profiles, `.zshrc`, env vars) -- see [references/ax-profiles.md](references/ax-profiles.md).

## Phase 1: Analysis (read-only — no code/files)

Detect from manifests + imports: language, package manager, LLM providers, frameworks, existing tracing (`TracerProvider`, `register()`, `ARIZE_*`/`OTEL_*`, Datadog/Honeycomb), existing Arize endpoint/region config (`ARIZE_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT`, an in-code Arize endpoint option, or an `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` confirmed to target Arize), and whether the app runs tools / an agent loop (manual CHAIN/TOOL spans only if the matched framework instrumentor doesn't already cover them — decided in Phase 2). **Confirm scope first** — a monorepo, multiple services, or multiple frameworks needs a "which one?" question before touching anything; don't pick for the user.

Output a short summary (stack, proposed integration, existing tracing, scope). If the target is clear and the user asked to instrument now, continue; if ambiguous or analysis-only was requested, stop and confirm.

## Phase 2: Implementation (after the target is confirmed)

1. **Fetch the matched integration doc** and follow its install + wiring verbatim.
2. **Install** with the detected package manager, before writing code — exact packages come from the matched doc. Python base: `arize-otel` (latest **0.13.0**, verify on PyPI) + `openinference-instrumentation-{name}` (package hyphens, import underscores). TS/JS: `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node` + the matched `@arizeai/openinference-*` (or a first-party exporter, e.g. Mastra's `@mastra/arize`). Go has **no integration doc** — see [references/go.md](references/go.md) for install, wiring, flush, and manual spans.
3. **Credentials and region** — app needs an API key + Space + exporter endpoint/region. Inspect only the target app's own config; never scan sibling repos/shell files, surface secrets, or accept a pasted key. See [references/credentials-and-config.md](references/credentials-and-config.md), [references/regions-and-endpoints.md](references/regions-and-endpoints.md), and [references/ax-profiles.md](references/ax-profiles.md).
4. **Centralize** init in one module, **before** any LLM client is created. Existing OTel → add Arize as an *additional* exporter; don't replace it.

**Auto vs manual:** prefer the auto-instrumentor — do **not** hand-roll spans it already covers (duplicates spans, drifts from semconv). Add manual spans only for logic no instrumentor sees, or when the stack has no instrumentor at all. **When the app calls the provider SDK directly, the OpenAI and Anthropic SDK instrumentors capture the LLM call — including the model's tool-call request (name + args) — but NOT the tool's execution, its return value, or the agent/chain boundary. A raw-SDK app with its own tool-calling loop MUST add a TOOL span per execution (to capture the result) and a CHAIN (or AGENT) span to group the turn**, or those never appear — do this with `@tracer.tool`/`@tracer.chain` decorators wherever the functions exist (they set kind, metadata, and status automatically); hand-roll spans only where no decoratable function does. Some agent frameworks instead drive the model through their own client layer and emit their own OpenTelemetry spans; for those, a provider instrumentor captures **nothing**, so instrument via the framework's integration page rather than the provider SDK. Framework instrumentors (LangChain/LangGraph/OpenAI Agents SDK) *typically* cover tools and chains — verify in the matched doc before skipping manual spans. Keep `register()`/`arize-otel-go` for setup; see [references/manual-spans.md](references/manual-spans.md) and [manual instrumentation](https://arize.com/docs/ax/instrument/manual-instrumentation).

**Cross-cutting (every stack):**
- **Project name is required** — missing it → HTTP 500 (`service.name` alone fails). Set as a resource attribute: Python `register(project_name=…)`; TS `SEMRESATTRS_PROJECT_NAME`/`model_id`; Go `Options{ProjectName}` or `openinference.project.name`.
- **Don't hand-roll a `TracerProvider`/exporter** — use `register()`/`arize-otel-go`; raw OTel only when integrating an existing provider.
- **Order:** register tracer → instrumentors → clients.
- **Region:** do not assume US. Preserve `ARIZE_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT` or an endpoint already confirmed to target Arize. A generic `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` may belong to an existing non-Arize exporter; preserve that exporter separately and ask for the Arize SaaS region instead of reusing it blindly. See [references/regions-and-endpoints.md](references/regions-and-endpoints.md).
- **Prefer `@tracer.*` decorators over hand-rolled spans** — they set kind, `input.value`/`output.value`, full TOOL metadata, and terminal status automatically, so they can't emit the `UNSET`/incomplete spans hand-rolled ones do. The decorator is on the function *definition*, so dynamic dispatch is no reason to hand-roll. See [references/manual-spans.md](references/manual-spans.md).
- **A hand-rolled span must set, before exit:** `openinference.span.kind`, `input.value`/`output.value`, and for a TOOL span all of `tool.name`/`tool.description`/`tool.parameters`. **Most-missed line:** `start_as_current_span` records a raised exception as `ERROR` but **never sets `OK`** — so add `span.set_status(Status(StatusCode.OK))` on the success path or the span exports `UNSET` and fails scoring. See [references/manual-spans.md](references/manual-spans.md).
- **Flush before exit** (CLI/scripts/notebooks) or async exports drop: Python `force_flush()`+`shutdown()`, TS `shutdown()`, Go `defer tp.Shutdown(ctx)` (never `log.Fatalf`/`os.Exit` mid-span). See [references/session-tracking.md](references/session-tracking.md).
- **Sessions:** for obvious multi-turn interactions (e.g. a multi-turn chatbot) or when the user asks, add `session.id` so turns group into one conversation — see [references/session-tracking.md](references/session-tracking.md).
- **Never silently override** the app's project/space/IDs/endpoint — surface mismatches.

## Verification

Done only when: app builds/typechecks, starts with tracing, emits ≥1 real request, and you confirm the trace in Arize **or** give a precise app-vs-Arize blocker. Trigger an LLM call, then use the **`arize-trace`** skill to confirm spans (kind, `input.value`/`output.value`, parent-child; CHAIN+TOOL if tools run). No traces → check `ARIZE_SPACE_ID`/`ARIZE_API_KEY`, init order, the configured collector endpoint/region, exporter logs (`GRPC_VERBOSITY=debug`); common causes: wrong region endpoint, missing project name (500), unflushed short-lived process, or export/verify **credential-context mismatch** (report it, don't rewrite config — [references/credentials-and-config.md](references/credentials-and-config.md)). For the deterministic trace-lookup sequence, blocker classification, and the post-arrival smoke check, follow [references/verification.md](references/verification.md).

## After a confirmed trace

Emit milestones (install → wiring → run → export → verify); mark recovered errors resolved; end separating done from blockers. Then briefly offer the next step: **`arize-trace`** (inspect/debug), **`arize-dataset`** (curate), **`arize-evaluator`** (evals), **`arize-experiment`** (compare), **`arize-prompt-optimization`** (improve prompt). Quality issues → **`arize-trace`** first.
