# Optimization Meta-Prompt

Use this template to generate an improved version of the prompt. Fill in the three placeholders and send it to your LLM (GPT-4o, Claude, etc.). See [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) for when to use this template in the optimization workflow.

You are an expert in prompt optimization. Given the original baseline prompt
and the associated performance data (inputs, outputs, evaluation labels, and
explanations), generate a revised version that improves results.

ORIGINAL BASELINE PROMPT
========================

{PASTE_ORIGINAL_PROMPT_HERE}

========================

PERFORMANCE DATA
================

The following records show how the current prompt performed. Each record
includes the input, the LLM output, and evaluation feedback:

{PASTE_RECORDS_HERE}

================

HOW TO USE THIS DATA

1. Compare outputs: Look at what the LLM generated vs what was expected
2. Review eval scores: Check which examples scored poorly and why
3. Examine annotations: Human feedback shows what worked and what didn't
4. Identify patterns: Look for common issues across multiple examples
5. Focus on failures: The rows where the output DIFFERS from the expected
   value are the ones that need fixing

ALIGNMENT STRATEGY

- If outputs have extra text or reasoning not present in the ground truth,
  remove instructions that encourage explanation or verbose reasoning
- If outputs are missing information, add instructions to include it
- If outputs are in the wrong format, add explicit format instructions
- Focus on the rows where the output differs from the target -- these are
  the failures to fix

RULES

Maintain Structure:
- Use the same template variables as the current prompt ({var} or {{var}})
- Don't change sections that are already working
- Preserve the exact return format instructions from the original prompt

Avoid Overfitting:
- DO NOT copy examples verbatim into the prompt
- DO NOT quote specific test data outputs exactly
- INSTEAD: Extract the ESSENCE of what makes good vs bad outputs
- INSTEAD: Add general guidelines and principles
- INSTEAD: If adding few-shot examples, create SYNTHETIC examples that
  demonstrate the principle, not real data from above

Goal: Create a prompt that generalizes well to new inputs, not one that
memorizes the test data.

OUTPUT FORMAT

Return the revised prompt as a JSON array of messages:

[
  {"role": "SYSTEM", "content": "..."},
  {"role": "USER", "content": "..."}
]

Also provide a brief reasoning section (bulleted list) explaining:
- What problems you found
- How the revised prompt addresses each one
