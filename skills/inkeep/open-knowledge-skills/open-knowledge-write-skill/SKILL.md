# Writing an OpenKnowledge skill

You are helping the user author an **Agent Skill** — a `SKILL.md` file (plus
optional `references/` and `scripts/`) that teaches an AI agent how to do a
recurring task. In OpenKnowledge a skill is a first-class, versioned,
installable artifact: you author it with the `write` / `edit` skill verbs, then
`install` it into the user's editors.

Skills earn their keep by being **recognized at the right moment** and **followed
faithfully**. Most of the craft is in two places: a `description` that triggers
reliably, and a body short and concrete enough that the agent actually does what
it says. Work the stages below in order, but jump to where the user already is.

## Stage 1 — Capture intent and classify the skill

**Gate — does this already exist? Check BEFORE you build.** First list managed
skills with `skills({})`, then read any likely match with `skills({ name })`;
these are the Project/Global skills OpenKnowledge already manages. Also search
the public marketplace with `skills({ query: "<2-4 trigger words>" })` before
drafting when the task sounds reusable beyond this project. Each marketplace row
returns `name`, `source`, and `description`; inspect the strongest descriptions,
then import a chosen candidate with `import({ source, skill: name, add: [...] })` and adapt
it only if reuse is the right call. Use the Vercel `find-skills` skill,
`npx skills find <query>`, or manual skills.sh search only when the OK MCP
`skills({ query })` path is unavailable. If the user already has a skills.sh page
open, pass the full skill-page URL as `source`, e.g.
`import({ source: "https://www.skills.sh/<owner>/<repo>/<skill>", add: [...] })` — the
middle segment is the REPO, not a literal `skills`. Do not
run `npx skills add` as the
default install path in this flow: import through OpenKnowledge
(`import({ source, skill, add })`) so the skill lands as a real folder with
provenance, versioning, and managed fan-out; `add` says where it goes, and
`install` afterwards changes where it lives. Use 2-4 concrete trigger phrases from the user's request plus
the domain or tool name, then open/read the strongest candidates' descriptions
before judging. If an existing or public skill covers most of it, STOP and
**recommend reuse** — a near-duplicate with overlapping triggers mis-fires and
dilutes both. If a public skill is close but not exact, decide WITH the user
whether to import/adapt it into OpenKnowledge, install it outside OK with the
Skills CLI, or write a narrower companion whose `description` explicitly hands
off to it. Build a new skill only when it is genuinely distinct. Surface the
overlap and the installed-skill plus marketplace search outcome before drafting
or writing anything. This is a disclosure gate: tell the user what you checked,
what matched, and why reuse/import/adapt/new-skill is the right next step. Never
discover overlap after the skill is written. If `skills({ query })` / skills.sh
is unreachable, say so plainly and continue with the installed-skill check.

Ask only what you can't infer:

- **What recurring task** should this skill handle? Get one concrete example.
- **Skill type**, because it sets how much rigor to apply:
  - **Reference / technique** (most skills) — "how to do X." Prose body, examples.
  - **Discipline** — enforces a behavior the agent tends to skip under pressure
    (e.g. "always write a failing test first"). These need the RED baseline +
    pressure-testing in Stage 4–6; reference skills don't.
- **Degrees of freedom** (calibrate body precision to task fragility):
  *high* (free prose — judgment tasks), *medium* (parameterized steps), *low*
  (a fixed `scripts/` command — when any deviation breaks the result). Don't
  over-specify a judgment task or under-specify a fragile one.

## Stage 2 — Resolve scope FIRST (never infer silently)

Scope determines where the skill lives and where `install` fans it. This is
the user's decision and has different blast radius — make it explicit.

| Scope | Lives in | `install` fans it to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Global** | a real folder under your home's skill roots (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`) | your editors, in **every** project |
| **Project** | a real folder in this repo's skill roots (e.g. `.claude/skills/<name>/` or the `.agents/skills/` hub — shared via git) | this project's editors; teammates get it on `git pull` |

Default heuristic: inside an OK project and the task is specific to it → **project**;
"for all my work / globally" → **global**; otherwise ask one question. State the
choice and its consequence before writing.

**Developing a skills repo or plugin? Then NEITHER scope applies.** If the repo
you are working in is itself a skill *distribution* — a plugin (e.g. a
`.claude-plugin/` manifest or marketplace listing) or a catalog repo that
shelves skills as `skills/<name>/` for others to import — the skill you are
authoring is a **product of that repo**, not an installation into it. Write it
in the repo's own layout, beside its sibling skills, following the format the
repo already uses. Do **not** place it under `.claude/skills/` or
`.agents/skills/` here, and do **not** `install` it: consumers get it by
installing the plugin or importing from the repo, and the plugin's own repo
loads nothing from itself. `install` is only for skills the *current* project
or user should load. If you are unsure whether the repo is a distribution or a
consumer, ask — writing to the wrong place ships a skill nobody can find.

## Stage 3 — Plan the contents

- **Body** = the durable, reusable instructions — under ~500 lines. If it's
  growing past that, move depth into `references/<topic>.md` (loaded only when
  needed) and point at it from the body. For a **project** skill the reference
  auto-connects in the graph either way, so a backticked `` `references/<topic>.md` ``
  path is fine; use a `[[references/<topic>]]` wiki-link only when you want the
  mention to be a clickable inline link. For a **global** skill use a plain
  backtick path — global references aren't graph docs, so a wiki-link there
  dangles. Keep references **one level deep**.
- **Do NOT include**: a README/CHANGELOG/QUICK_REFERENCE, install instructions
  for the skill itself, version histories, or anything host-specific. The skill
  is the instructions, not documentation about the instructions.
- For a **discipline** skill, plan the failure mode you're correcting and how
  you'll prove the skill fixes it (Stage 4).

## Stage 4 — RED baseline (discipline skills only)

Before writing the skill, run the scenario WITHOUT it and capture what the agent
does wrong — verbatim, including its rationalizations ("the test is trivial so I
skipped it"). Those rationalizations are the exact loopholes the skill body must
close. Run the scenario in a fresh agent session with the skill absent — a new
chat, a sub-agent, or a second terminal — and keep the transcript; if you have no
way to run it clean, reason through the baseline with the user instead. Skip this
stage for plain reference skills.

## Stage 5 — Draft the skill

Author the source with the skill verb (fs-direct; a live preview updates if a
server is running):

```
write({ skill: { name: "<lowercase-hyphen-name>", description: "<triggers>", body: "<markdown>", scope: "project" } })
```

Frontmatter contract (validated on write — get it right):
- `name` — lowercase letters, digits, hyphens; ≤64; **equals the directory**.
- `description` — **≤1024 chars, no XML tags, no `version` field**. See Stage 7.
- Nothing else. OK never injects its own frontmatter; bookkeeping lives in `.ok/`.

Write the body as direct instructions to the agent (imperative, second person),
concrete over abstract.

Add depth files — `references/*.md` (loaded on demand) and `scripts/*` (shown as
text, never executed by OK) — through the skill verbs, never native `Write`/`cat`:

```
# write one or more bundle files (independent of body — no need to resend SKILL.md)
write({ skill: { name: "<name>", files: [{ path: "references/tiers.md", content: "..." }] } })

# surgical edit inside one bundle file (mirrors edit({ document }))
edit({ skill: { name: "<name>", file: "references/tiers.md", find: "...", replace: "..." } })

# list the bundle, then read one file (no native cat)
skills({ name: "<name>" })                         # → files: [{ path, kind }]
skills({ name: "<name>", file: "references/tiers.md" })   # → { path, kind, text }

# delete specific bundle files (omit `files` to delete the whole skill)
delete({ skill: { name: "<name>", files: ["references/tiers.md"] } })
```

Paths are skill-relative and must stay inside the skill dir (no `../`, no
absolute paths). `references/` and `scripts/` are the conventional homes and the
ones to reach for; other roots (`assets/`, a per-harness dir) are accepted
because published skills ship them and an import preserves them verbatim. Keep
references one level deep. A project `.md` reference becomes a live content doc that
auto-connects to its SKILL in the graph regardless of how the body mentions it —
a backticked `` `references/<name>.md` `` path joins the graph just like a
`[[references/<name>]]` wiki-link. Reach for a wiki-link (or
`[label](references/<name>.md)`) only when you want a clickable inline link.
Global skills are different: their references aren't graph docs, so use a plain
backtick path there — a wiki-link would dangle.

## Stage 6 — GREEN eval + refactor

Re-run the scenario WITH the skill. For a discipline skill, **pressure-test**:
combine 2–3 pressures (time, authority, sunk cost) and confirm the agent still
follows the rule — then patch any loophole and re-test (`references/pressure-testing.md`).
For a reference skill, confirm the agent now does the task correctly and the body
isn't longer than it needs to be. Cut anything the agent already knows.

## Stage 7 — Optimize the description (this is what makes the skill fire)

The `description` is the **only** thing the agent sees when deciding whether to
load the skill. Get it right (`references/description-optimization.md`):
- **Triggers, not a summary.** Say WHEN to use it, in the user's words and
  phrasings — NOT a recap of the body. Summarizing the workflow in the
  description makes the agent follow the description and skip the body.
- **Concrete and a little pushy** to fight under-triggering: name the situations,
  verbs, and phrasings that should activate it.
- Sanity-check against near-miss queries: phrasings that SHOULD trigger it and
  adjacent ones that should NOT.

## Stage 8 — Install (choose where it's available)

The skill is already live for whichever agent reads the folder it was created
in — its own folder IS the skill (there is no draft state). `install` manages
WHERE ELSE it is available, additively:

```
install({ name: "<name>", add: ["codex", "opencode"] })   // add locations
install({ name: "<name>", remove: ["codex"] })            // remove locations
install({ name: "<name>", add: ["codex"], mode: "link" }) // ...as a symlink
install({ name: "<name>", convert: ["codex"], mode: "copy" })  // change one location's form
install({ name: "<name>", source: ".team/skills" })       // move the real folder (run alone)
```

Location ids are editor host ids (`claude` … `pi`), `agents` (the
vendor-neutral hub), or a custom root path like `.team/skills`.

**Which form a location takes.** `mode` applies only to the locations the call
names — those in `add`, or those in `convert` — and to nothing else. Omit it on
`add` and the new location takes the form the skill already uses. There is no
skill-wide mode: installing never rewrites a location you did not name.
Changing an existing location is `convert`, which leaves membership alone; pass
every location to make them uniform.

**What each form means.** A symlink points at the source, so it cannot drift. A
copy is its own folder and refreshes automatically from the source — until
someone hand-edits it, at which point it forks and is never overwritten again.

**Lifecycle.** Edit with `edit({ skill })`; it routes to the source and versions
in place. There is no "uninstall everywhere" — removing every other location
still leaves the source folder loading for its agent, and a skill stops existing
only via `delete({ skill })`, which removes the source and every location. Roll
a **project** skill back with `history({ skill })` → `restore_version({ skill,
version })`; global skills are unversioned in this build. For a project skill,
commit the skill folders — they are ordinary files in git, so teammates get them
on pull.

## Reminders

- Prefer ONE good skill over many overlapping ones; split only when triggers diverge. (The Stage 1 gate is where you ENFORCE this — don't leave overlap to discover later.)
- Scope is the only placement decision — don't fold harness/format/toolchain assumptions into it, and don't bake one into the scope question's wording. You are authoring an OpenKnowledge skill: create it with `write({ skill })` — it lands as a real folder at the project's default skill home with attribution and versioning — and fan it out with `install`; don't hand-scatter copies across editor dirs, because `install` owns fan-out and refreshes unedited copies from the source (a hand-edited copy forks and stops refreshing). If you load this flow, author through it.
- Ground claims about how skills behave (versioning, install targets, scope semantics) in this guide or the tool descriptions — don't assert system facts from assumption.
- Avoid blanket ALWAYS/NEVER rules without a stated reason — they read as noise and
  get ignored. Explain the why.
- A skill that ships executable `scripts/` is projected verbatim into another
  agent's trust domain — only include scripts the user has reviewed.
