  AI video & audio summarizer + repackager. Summarize YouTube, Bilibili,
  podcasts, TikTok, Twitter/X, Xiaohongshu, and any online video or audio,
  then optionally turn the takeaway into a TikTok-style vertical music video.
  Use when the user wants to summarize a video, extract transcripts/subtitles,
  get chapter-by-chapter summaries, understand video content quickly, or
  remix a long-form video into a short vertical MV.
  Triggers: "summarize this video", "what's this video about", "extract subtitles",
  "总结这个视频", "帮我看看这个视频讲了什么", "video summary", "podcast notes",
  "YouTube summary", "B站总结", "get transcript", "video to notes",
  "video to TikTok MV", "把视频变成 TikTok", "video to song", "做一个 TikTok 视频".
  Works via bibi CLI (macOS/Windows) or OpenAPI (Linux / any platform without CLI).

# BibiGPT — AI Video & Audio Summarizer

This file is a **discovery stub, not the usage guide**. It tells you which
mode you are in and where the live docs are. The live sources always match
the current product; anything copied into this file would go stale.

## 1. Detect Mode

Run `scripts/bibi-check.sh` if present, or check in order:

| Check | Mode | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `command -v bibi` | **CLI** — best: local files, desktop login | macOS / Windows / Linux desktop app |
| `$BIBI_API_TOKEN` set | **API** — HTTP calls, works anywhere | token: https://bibigpt.co/user/integration |
| MCP client available | **MCP** — zero install | connect `https://bibigpt.co/api/mcp` (OAuth 2.1) |

Neither available → install the desktop app (`brew install --cask jimmylv/bibigpt/bibigpt`
on macOS, `winget install BibiGPT` on Windows, `curl -fsSL https://bibigpt.co/install.sh | bash`
on Linux) or get an API token. Details: `references/installation.md`.

## 2. Load Live Docs (per mode)

**CLI mode** — the CLI is the always-current doc source:

```bash
bibi check-update            # once per session; run `bibi upgrade` if outdated
bibi --help                  # full command surface, grouped, with examples
bibi <command> --help        # progressive help — every --help includes examples
bibi commands                # re-fetch server-defined commands (new capabilities
                             # appear here without a binary update)
```

**API mode** — the machine-readable spec is the source of truth:

```
https://bibigpt.co/api/openapi.json      # all endpoints, schemas, auth
```

`references/api.md` has curl examples but the spec wins on conflict.

**MCP mode** — connect and list tools; they are self-describing:

```
https://bibigpt.co/api/mcp               # Streamable HTTP, OAuth 2.1
```

**Latest docs without reinstalling** — this repo is served raw from GitHub:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JimmyLv/bibigpt-skill/main/skills/bibi/SKILL.md
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JimmyLv/bibigpt-skill/main/skills/bibi/references/<name>.md
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JimmyLv/bibigpt-skill/main/skills/bibi/workflows/<name>.md
```

If a local `workflows/` or `references/` path below is missing (embedded-only
install via `bibi skill`), fetch it from the raw URL above instead.

## 3. Intent Routing

| User Intent | Workflow |
|------------|---------|
| Summarize a video/audio URL | → `workflows/quick-summary.md` |
| Chapter-by-chapter breakdown, detailed analysis | → `workflows/deep-dive.md` |
| Get subtitles, extract transcript, raw text | → `workflows/transcript-extract.md` |
| Turn into article, blog post, 公众号图文, 小红书 | → `workflows/article-rewrite.md` |
| Turn into TikTok / Reels / Shorts-style music video | → `workflows/video-to-tiktok-mv.md` |
| Process multiple URLs, batch summarize | → `workflows/batch-process.md` |
| Research a topic across multiple videos | → `workflows/research-compile.md` |
| Save to Notion, Obsidian, export notes | → `workflows/export-notes.md` |
| Analyze visual content, slides, on-screen text | → `workflows/visual-analysis.md` |
| Check current account, plan, or remaining minutes | → `workflows/account-check.md` |
| Browse / search saved videos, "what have I summarized" | → `workflows/library-browse.md` |
| Manage channel subscriptions, list/sub/unsub, RSS preview | → `workflows/channels-manage.md` |
| What's new across my subscriptions, latest feed, daily digest | → `workflows/feed-latest.md` |
| Manage collections, list/create/share saved videos as a set | → `workflows/collections-manage.md` |
| Manage personal notes on saved videos, edit summaries | → `workflows/notes-manage.md` |
| Generate mindmap, visual analysis, custom-prompt summary, Notion export, collection chat | → `workflows/advanced-tools.md` |
| **HTTP 402 / "需要付款" / Alipay AI 钱包 / no token + China user** | → `references/billing-aipay.md` |

Disambiguation: intent matches more than one workflow → ask **one** clarifying
question first. Matches none → ask what they want; **do not guess**. Bare URL
with no context → default to `workflows/quick-summary.md`.

## 4. Quick One-Liners (CLI mode)

For single-command requests that don't need a full workflow — discover the
rest via `bibi --help`:

```bash
bibi summarize "<URL-or-local-file>"     # quick summary (local: .mp4 .mp3 .m4a ...)
bibi summarize "<INPUT>" --chapter       # chapter summary
bibi summarize "<INPUT>" --subtitle      # transcript only
bibi me                                  # account, plan, remaining minutes
```

URLs containing `?` or `&` must be quoted. API mode has no local-file upload —
guide the user to a public URL (OSS/S3) first, see `references/supported-platforms.md`.

## 5. Payment Fallback (HTTP 402)

If no auth is set and the user has an Alipay account, BibiGPT may respond
with HTTP `402 Payment Required` + `Payment-Needed` header (AI 收 protocol).
The bibi CLI prints a stable marker line `[HTTP/402 Payment Required]` to
stderr before any human-readable prompt. When either signal appears, route to
`references/billing-aipay.md` instead of treating the call as failed — the
agent can resolve payment automatically via
[`@alipay/agent-payment`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@alipay/agent-payment)
or a one-off QR purchase.
