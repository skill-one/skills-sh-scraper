# x402 Selling Reference — full mode commands, contracts, operations

Complete command examples, billing contracts, and deployment operations.
Read this BEFORE deploying any mode beyond a basic `pay_per_use`.

## Platform modes — full commands & contract

Platform modes implement the Starchild community-gateway billing contract
(x402-facilitator `docs/pricing-models.md`): 402 JSON body with `accepts` as a
**list** (multi-accepts, one entry per network — the buyer picks one chain per
payment), `accepts[].pricingModel`, buyer sends `X-PAYMENT`, the **facilitator
is the single source of truth for "already paid"** (no local payment state),
and every settle auto-callbacks community-gateway for purchase/call records.

### Multi-chain: `--networks all` (default) vs custom

By default a service follows the **platform mainnet full set** (Base + Monad +
Robinhood + X Layer + Solana): the 402 challenge returns an accepts list with one entry per chain,
and the buyer picks one chain to pay on. Lock to specific chains with
`--networks` (comma-separated CAIP-2 list).

```bash
FAC=https://starchild-x402-facilitator.fly.dev

# pay_per_use: verify -> settle on EVERY request
# --networks defaults to "all" (Base + Monad + Robinhood + X Layer + Solana mainnet); omit it to follow the
# platform full set. The 402 returns a multi-accepts list.
python3 skills/x402/scripts/monetize.py --name my-api --upstream-port 5173 \
    --mode pay_per_use --price 0.01 --facilitator $FAC

# custom: lock to a single chain (or a comma-separated list)

    --mode pay_per_use --price 0.01 --networks eip155:8453 --facilitator $FAC

# lifetime: one payment = permanent access (checked via /facilitator/access-status)
# The gateway checks access-status automatically:
#   - With --facilitator-admin-token: calls facilitator directly
#   - Without it: proxies through community-gateway (COMMUNITY_PUBLIC_URL env,
#     already set in user containers) with CONTAINER_JWT Bearer auth; gateway
#     holds the admin token server-side (no COMMUNITY_GATEWAY_KEY)
python3 skills/x402/scripts/monetize.py --name my-api --upstream-port 5173 \
    --mode lifetime --price 5.00 --facilitator $FAC

# monthly: natural-month subscription (same day next month, clamped to month end;
# expiry computed from /facilitator/settlements confirmed_at)
python3 skills/x402/scripts/monetize.py --name my-api --upstream-port 5173 \
    --mode monthly --price 10.00 --facilitator $FAC

# weekly / quarterly / yearly: fixed-length subscriptions (7/90/365 days after the
# newest qualifying payment).
# Facilitator contract: queried as access-status pricing_model=monthly +
# period_days=7/90/365 (monthly WITHOUT period_days = natural-month semantics).
python3 skills/x402/scripts/monetize.py --name my-api --upstream-port 5173 \
    --mode weekly --price 3.00 --facilitator $FAC

# multi-plan (docs/pricing-models.md): --mode is the DEFAULT plan,
# each --plan MODE=PRICE adds an option. Buyers pick a plan per request with the
# X-Pricing-Model header; the 402 quotes THAT plan's amount (audit requirement).
# pay_per_use cannot be combined with other plans.
python3 skills/x402/scripts/monetize.py --name my-api --upstream-port 5173 \
    --mode monthly --price 10.00 --plan weekly=3 --plan yearly=90 \
    --facilitator $FAC

# prepaid: one on-chain deposit, then every call is a millisecond off-chain debit.
# For HIGH-FREQUENCY / metered APIs: no per-call settle (2-5s + gas + 30/min
# rate limit), per-call price can be sub-cent. --deposit = suggested top-up size
# (default 100 calls worth, min $0.10 = facilitator X402_MIN_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT).
# Prepaid balance is cumulative across chains: a buyer who deposits on Monad
# can spend on Base (same pooled (payer, pay_to) balance).
python3 skills/x402/scripts/monetize.py --name my-api --upstream-port 5173 \
    --mode prepaid --price 0.001 --deposit 1.00 --facilitator $FAC
```

Default protected routes: `/api/*` (override with `--route 'METHOD /path'`;
one service price via `--price` — platform modes have no per-route pricing).
lifetime/monthly/weekly/quarterly/yearly check "already paid" via the
facilitator's `/access-status` endpoint. The gateway resolves this
automatically: with `--facilitator-admin-token` it calls the facilitator
directly; without it, it proxies through community-gateway
(`COMMUNITY_PUBLIC_URL`, already set in user containers) which holds the
admin token server-side — **no admin token needed in user containers**.
The proxy call authenticates with the machine `CONTAINER_JWT` (Bearer);
do **not** use `COMMUNITY_GATEWAY_KEY` / `X-Internal-Key`.
Lifetime semantics: first call settles on-chain; repeat calls pass the
already-paid check with NO second charge.

## Limited-time free promotion (plans-280-35)

Service-level free window on a **listed paid** marketplace service. **Not per-endpoint**:
all API paths on that `service_listings` row share one `free_promo_start/end`.

**One-line mental model:** Free = limited-time **identity-light access + no charge**.
Buyer still proves a wallet (x402 verify with **amount 0**). Platform does **not** settle
or debit list price. When the window ends, normal paid pricing resumes automatically.

### What free is / is not

| Free IS | Free is NOT |
|---------|-------------|
| A time window on one marketplace **service** (`service_id`) | Anonymous open internet (still need a signing wallet) |
| Zero USDC charge during the window | A gift of lifetime/monthly entitlement after free ends |
| Platform gateway path: amount-0 verify + free-call accounting | A reason to put `service_id` into the x402 wire protocol |
| Compatible with all platform billing modes | Automatic unlock of your **custom** API keys (see P3) |

### API

```bash
# Set free promo (owner JWT)
curl -X PUT "$GATEWAY/api/services/$SERVICE_ID/free-promo" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"free_start":"now","free_end":"2026-09-01T00:00:00Z","note":"Launch week free"}'

# Public status
curl "$GATEWAY/api/services/$SERVICE_ID/free-status"

# Cancel early
curl -X DELETE "$GATEWAY/api/services/$SERVICE_ID/free-promo" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT"
```

Max duration: **90 days**. UI may hand you a chat prompt — still run the playbook below before PUT.

---

### Runtime contract (platform gateway + facilitator)

#### Request flow (platform gateway)

```
request
  → free-promo-check (community, by pay_to + optional resource)
  → if FREE:
       402 accepts.amount = "0"   # if no X-PAYMENT yet
       verify(amount_override=0)  # identity only
       NO settle / NO positive debit
       inject X-Free-Promo / X-Free-Promo-End / X-Payment-Payer
       proxy upstream
       free-call-callback (call_type=free_promo)
  → if NOT free:
       normal paid path (list-price 402 → verify → settle/debit → already_paid)
```

**Order matters:** free is evaluated **before** “already paid”. During free, even a prior
buyer is served on the free path (no new settle/debit).

#### Hard rules

1. **Identity, not full anonymous.** Buyer still sends `X-PAYMENT`. During free the
   platform gateway challenges with **`accepts.amount = "0"`** so a wallet **without
   list-price USDC** can still sign/verify. Gas for settle is irrelevant because settle
   is skipped.
2. **No charge during free.** Gateway must not settle or positive-debit. Facilitator L1
   also rejects positive `/facilitator/debit` with `free_promo_active` (negative debit /
   refunds still allowed). Direct `/settle` during free is blocked at facilitator when
   free is active for that `pay_to`.
3. **Resource isolation (x402 `resource`, usually the path).** Do **not** invent a
   `service_id` field on the wire. `access-status?resource=/api/a` only unlocks path A;
   payment for A must not unlock B on the same `pay_to`. Empty-resource legacy rows do
   **not** unlock a resource-scoped check.
4. **Two ledgers stay separate.**
   - community: books by **service_id** (free_promo / settle / debit rows)
   - facilitator access: books by **payer + pay_to + resource**
5. **Upstream headers** (set only by platform gateway — clients cannot spoof trust):
   - `X-Free-Promo: 1`
   - `X-Free-Promo-End: <iso>`
   - `X-Payment-Payer: <wallet>`
   - Platform modes still forward buyer `X-Api-Key` when present (P3 hybrid).
6. **After `free_end`:** 402 returns **list-price** amount again; unpaid visitors must pay;
   already-paid subscribers keep their paid entitlement.

#### Buyer agent behavior during free

| Step | What to do |
|------|------------|
| Discover | Unpaid GET → 402. If `accepts[].amount == "0"` (or free-status true), this is a free window, not a $0 product forever. |
| Sign | Sign the **quoted** amount (0 during free). Do **not** force list-price signing. |
| Cap | `max_amount_atomic` may be 0 or tiny; free verify should not require funded USDC. |
| Expectation | 200 with **no** new settlement / no debit. Optional upstream body may show free markers. |
| After free | Same URL returns list-price 402; pay normally. Free history ≠ paid subscription. |

---

### Agent self-check playbook (MUST run before enabling free)

When the user asks to enable free promo (including UI-filled prompts), **do not** blind-PUT.
Detect pattern → adjust if needed → then enable → verify → report.

#### Step A — Identify billing mode

| `pricing_model` | Platform charge path | Free-period charge behavior |
|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| `pay_per_use` | settle every call | skip settle; record `free_promo` call |
| `lifetime` | settle once; later `already_paid` / access-status | skip settle; free access via free path / access-status |
| `monthly` | settle once / natural month | same; **free ≠ gift N subscription days** |
| `weekly` / `quarterly` / `yearly` | fixed-length pass | same as monthly |
| `prepaid` | deposit-settle + debit | skip **positive** debit; refunds still ok |
| multi-plan | plan via `X-Pricing-Model` | free is **service-level** (all plans on that listing) |
| legacy `payperuse` / `subscription` / `metered` | local ledger / API keys | treat as **custom ACL** risk — Step B/C |

#### Step B — Identify access-control pattern

| Pattern | How to detect | Need code change for free? | What to do |
|---------|---------------|----------------------------|------------|
| **P1 Platform gateway only** | Upstream has no key/session ACL; all traffic via x402 gateway | **No** | PUT free-promo + verify |
| **P2 access-status / already_paid** | Middleware only checks facilitator access-status or gateway already_paid | **No** (platform grants free) | PUT free-promo + verify |
| **P3 Custom API keys / upstream ACL** | Upstream requires own monthly key, JWT, API key table, etc. | **Yes** | Patch ACL first, then PUT |
| **P4 Hybrid** | Gateway bills + upstream also checks keys | **Yes** if upstream can 401 free users | Honor free headers **or** free-status |
| **P5 Multi-endpoint one listing** | multiple paths on one service | Scope only | Free covers **all** paths on this listing; split listings if only some paths should be free |

#### Step C — Required adjustments by pattern

**P1 / P2:** none beyond API enable (platform gateway already does amount=0 + no settle).

**P3 / P4 — minimal upstream patch (required):**

```python
# Pseudocode — run BEFORE enabling free if upstream has its own ACL
def allow(request):
    if request.headers.get("X-Free-Promo") == "1":
        return True  # optional: stricter rate-limit for free users
    if valid_own_api_key_or_session(request):
        return True
    return False  # 401
```

Do **not** trust a client-supplied `X-Free-Promo` unless the request already passed the
**platform gateway** (gateway strips/spoof-guards payment headers and injects free headers
itself). If your service is public without the gateway, poll free-status server-side instead.

**Self-built charge path (NOT platform gateway) — mandatory checklist:**

1. While free: 402 / payment requirements use **`amount = "0"`** (buyers may have **no USDC**).
2. Verify identity only; **do not** settle or positive-debit list price during free.
3. Record free usage via community free-call-callback **or** your own analytics; do not fake a paid settle.
4. Honor `X-Free-Promo` **or** poll `GET /api/services/:id/free-status` / internal free-promo-check;
   bind access to `free_end` (never mint a hardcoded “7-day key”).
5. After free ends: restore list-price amount and normal settle/debit within cache TTL.
6. Keep x402 `resource` = the real request path so access isolation stays correct.

**Prepaid:** platform prepaid mode skips debit while free. Any **custom** debit client must
call free-promo-check and refuse positive debits while free (refunds/negative debits OK).

**Legacy subscription/metered local keys:** same as P3 — free will not auto-issue credits/keys.

#### Step D — Enable + verify (minimum matrix)

1. `PUT /api/services/:id/free-promo` with `free_start=now`, `free_end=<iso>`, optional `note`.
2. `GET /api/services/:id/free-status` → `is_free=true`, check `remaining_seconds`.
3. **Probe matrix (do these before telling the user “done”):**

| # | Probe | Pass criteria |
|---|-------|----------------|
| D1 | Unpaid GET (no X-PAYMENT) | 402 and `accepts[0].amount == "0"` (platform gateway) |
| D2 | Buyer with wallet, **no USDC** / amount-0 payment | 200; **no** settlement tx; optional `X-Free-Promo` upstream |
| D3 | P3 upstream without own key during free | 200 if free headers honored; **401 means you missed Step C** |
| D4 | Facilitator positive debit (prepaid) during free | rejected `free_promo_active` |
| D5 | After DELETE free-promo (wait ~cache TTL) | 402 list-price amount again; unpaid 402; paid path works |

4. Report to user: pattern (P1–P5), code changes (if any), `free_end`, service-level scope,
   and that free does **not** equal a paid subscription after the window.

#### Step E — Cancel / expiry

- Owner cancel: `DELETE /api/services/:id/free-promo`.
- Natural expiry: wall clock past `free_end` (no DELETE needed).
- Caches: gateway/facilitator may cache free-status for a short TTL — allow ~30s before
  insisting paid path is back. Positive free cache is sticky on facilitator errors; negative
  cache is **not** trusted (so enabling free is not hidden by a stale “not free”).

### Resource, pay_to, and multi-service (read this)

| Concept | Role |
|---------|------|
| `pay_to` | Provider wallet receiving funds / access key with facilitator |
| `resource` | x402 path (e.g. `/api/hello`) — **access isolation key** |
| `service_id` | Marketplace row — community accounting only, **not** an x402 protocol field |

Rules agents must follow:

- One listing ≈ one primary public URL/path family; free is **per listing**, all its paths.
- Same `pay_to` with two listings/paths: paying A must not unlock B → always pass `resource`
  into access-status / already_paid (platform gateway does this).
- Do **not** add non-standard `service_id` into payment payloads to “fix” isolation.

---

### Common failure modes (seller)

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Free user gets 402 with **list price** | Gateway not on free path / free-status false / wrong service | Check free-status; confirm traffic hits **gateway** port not upstream |
| Free user verify fails / needs USDC | Challenge still uses list-price amount | Platform: upgrade gateway; custom: force `amount="0"` while free |
| Free user 200 at gateway but upstream 401 | P3/P4 custom ACL | Honor `X-Free-Promo` or free-status in upstream |
| Free user charged on-chain | Custom path still settling | Disable settle/debit while free; rely on facilitator L1 as backstop |
| After free, still amount 0 | Cache or free not cleared | DELETE free-promo; wait TTL; re-check free-status |
| Service B unlocked after paying A | access-status without resource | Pass resource path; do not grant on pay_to alone |
| Free counted on wrong listing | shared pay_to + weak resource match | Ensure api_endpoint paths differ; free-call prefers currently-free listing |

---

### Free promo vs monthly / custom keys (summary)

| Seller setup | Code change? |
|--------------|--------------|
| Platform gateway only, no upstream ACL | No |
| ACL via access-status / already_paid | No |
| Own monthly/API keys in upstream | **Yes** — honor `X-Free-Promo` or free-status |
| Self-built x402 middleware (no platform gateway) | **Yes** — amount 0 + no settle/debit + free-status |

Free traffic does **not** create a paid monthly/lifetime settlement. After free ends, unpaid
buyers must pay again. Already-paid buyers keep paid rights; free history alone does not.


## Legacy/extended modes (local-ledger billing — still supported)

```bash
# per-call pricing via x402 SDK middleware (V2 PAYMENT-REQUIRED headers)
python3 skills/x402/scripts/monetize.py --name my-api --upstream-port 5173 \
    --mode payperuse --route 'GET /api/*=$0.01'

# subscription: buyers top up via x402 -> get API key + credits, 1 credit/call
python3 skills/x402/scripts/monetize.py --name my-api --upstream-port 5173 \
    --mode subscription --price-per-credit 0.001 --min-credits 100 \
    --route 'GET /api/*=1'

# metered: same as subscription but routes cost different unit weights
python3 skills/x402/scripts/monetize.py --name my-api --upstream-port 5173 \
    --mode metered --price-per-credit 0.001 --min-credits 100 \
    --route 'GET /api/cheap/*=1' --route 'POST /api/heavy=25'
```

These keep payment state in the gateway's local SQLite ledger (deterministic
API keys, credit refunds on upstream 5xx). For new deployments prefer
`--mode prepaid` (same prepaid-credit UX, balance held by the facilitator
instead of a local SQLite file); use these modes only when you need
`timepass` (no platform equivalent) or to keep an existing deployment running.

Output includes `gateway_port`. **Expose the GATEWAY port, not the upstream**
(via `preview` or community-publish). `pay_to` defaults to the user's Privy
EVM wallet — revenue lands there directly.

Registry of all monetized services: `/data/workspace/.x402/services.json`.
Per-service config/log/state: `/data/workspace/.x402/<name>/`.

## Billing mode decision notes

Prefer **platform** modes: they match the community-gateway audit checklist,
get automatic purchase/call records via the settle callback, and keep zero
payment state in the gateway. `prepaid` supersedes the local-ledger
`subscription`/`metered` modes for new deployments: same prepaid-credit UX,
but the balance lives in the FACILITATOR (survives gateway restarts/moves,
auditable by platform ops) instead of a gateway-local SQLite file. The
legacy/extended modes remain for pre-2.1 deployments and for the timepass
model the platform contract doesn't cover.

### How prepaid works (facilitator balance primitives)

```
first call    buyer signs deposit ($1)  -> gateway -> /facilitator/deposit-settle
                                            (ONE on-chain settle, credits balance)
every call    buyer signs per-call price -> gateway verifies sig (auth only,
                                            NEVER settled) -> /facilitator/debit
                                            (off-chain, ~ms) -> forward upstream
upstream 5xx  gateway auto-refunds the debit (negative debit, request_id:refund)
balance empty gateway answers 402 insufficient_balance with accepts.amount =
              deposit size -> client auto-signs the top-up and retries
```

Contract details:
- 402 challenge: `accepts` is a **list** (multi-accepts, one entry per
  network); each entry has `pricingModel = "prepaid"`, `amount` = per-call
  price normally (deposit size when topping up), and extra fields
  `depositAtomic` + `pricePerCallAtomic` telling buyers both numbers.
- The per-call X-PAYMENT signature is authentication only — the gateway calls
  /verify (cached per signature until its validBefore) then /facilitator/debit;
  the signed value is settled ONLY when it is an actual deposit (value >=
  depositAtomic AND balance insufficient). Buyer exposure to a malicious
  gateway is therefore one per-call price, same as pay_per_use.
- Debit idempotency: gateway generates a fresh `request_id` (uuid) per call;
  the facilitator binds request_id to (payer, amount) — cross-payer reuse is 409.
- Route `units` multiply the per-call price (metered pricing, e.g.
  `--route 'POST /api/heavy=25'` charges 25x).
- Deposit minimum: facilitator `X402_MIN_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT` (default $0.10).
- **Multi-chain cumulative balance**: the facilitator ledger key is
  `(payer, pay_to)`, NOT per-network. A buyer who deposits on Monad can spend
  on Base — the balance is pooled. The buyer picks one chain per deposit
  (one accept from the multi-accepts list); the resulting credit is chain-agnostic.

### Connecting to the marketplace (community-publish)

After `monetize.py` starts the gateway, list the service on the marketplace
via the `community-publish` skill so buyers can discover and pay it:

```python
# community-publish skill (required fields shown; see community-publish SKILL.md)
create_paid_service(
    name="my-api",
    description="Short description of the paid API",
    category="工具服务",
    service_type="paid_api",          # or "paid_project" — NOT "api"
    api_endpoint="https://community.iamstarchild.com/<user>-<slug>/api/data",
    provider_wallet="<your EVM address — same on every chain>",
    pricing_model="pay_per_use",      # or lifetime/monthly/weekly/...
    price=0.01,                       # float USDC, not a string
    api_documentation="...",          # required for paid_api
    example_request="...",            # required for paid_api
    example_response="...",           # required for paid_api
    # networks_mode="all" is the default — omit it to follow platform mainnets
    # networks_mode="custom", supported_networks=["eip155:8453"],  # lock chain
)
publish_service(service_id)
```

The listing's `networks_mode` should match the gateway's config: `all` for a
multi-accepts gateway (default), `custom` + a list for a locked-chain gateway.
The marketplace reads `all` as "current platform full set" at display time, so
adding a new chain later requires no listing update.

### Multi-plan services (docs/pricing-models.md)

One service can offer several pricing options simultaneously (e.g. weekly $3 /
monthly $10 / yearly $90 / lifetime $150). Contract (community-gateway audits
this per plan before listing):

- Config: `"plans": {"weekly": {"price_usd": "3"}, ...}`; `"mode"` is the
  DEFAULT plan. CLI: `--plan MODE=PRICE` (repeatable).
- Buyer selects a plan per request with the `X-Pricing-Model` header
  (`client.paid_request(..., pricing_model="yearly")`); the 402 then quotes
  THAT plan's `accepts.amount` + `pricingModel`. Unknown plan -> HTTP 400
  listing available plans. No header -> default plan; its 402 (and
  `/.well-known/x402`) carries a `plans` map with every option's accepts.
- Combination rules (enforced by the gateway): `pay_per_use` cannot be
  combined with anything (startup error). Before charging under ANY plan the
  gateway checks access under ALL subscription plans of the service — a
  lifetime holder requesting the weekly plan is never re-charged
  (access-status is consulted per plan until a hit, with zero settles).
- Subscriptions + prepaid can be combined: a subscription holder is forwarded
  without debiting the prepaid balance.
- weekly/quarterly/yearly access checks go to the facilitator as
  `pricing_model=monthly&period_days=7|90|365` (period_days contract) with
  `min_amount` = that plan's price; the access cache is keyed per
  (payer, plan).

Ready-to-use config templates (fill `pay_to` + `upstream`):
platform — `templates/pay_per_use.json`, `templates/lifetime.json`,
`templates/monthly.json`, `templates/weekly.json`, `templates/quarterly.json`,
`templates/yearly.json`, `templates/prepaid.json`, `templates/multi_plan.json`;
legacy/extended — `templates/payperuse.json`, `templates/subscription.json`,
`templates/metered.json`, `templates/timepass.json`.
Timepass CLI: `--mode timepass --pass-days 30 --pass-price 4.99`; repeat
purchases EXTEND expiry from max(now, current expiry). Prepaid behavior: one
on-chain deposit, then pure off-chain per-call debits (sub-second), exact
balance accounting, automatic refund on upstream 5xx.
Buyers need NO special handling: `client.paid_request` detects the prepaid
challenge, signs the per-call price for auth, and auto-signs the deposit only
when the gateway answers insufficient_balance (spend guard applies to both).

Subscription/metered specifics:
- Account = payer wallet address; API key is **deterministic** per payer (re-topup returns the same key).
- Top-up: buyer x402-pays `POST /x402/topup` → key returned immediately, credits added in the settle hook.
- Ledger (SQLite, `state/ledger.db`): settlement `tx_hash` is UNIQUE → replayed settlements can never double-credit.
- Refund semantics: upstream unreachable or 5xx → units auto-refunded (buyer never pays for our failure).
- Buyer endpoints: `GET /x402/balance` (X-API-Key), `GET /x402/info` (public pricing), `GET /x402/health`.

## Always-on availability (required for listed paid services)

A published paid service must stay reachable 24/7. Two platform behaviors
work against that — handle both when you publish:

1. **Idle suspend** (automatic): the platform suspends idle machines. Busy
   signals (interactive runs, active previews, scheduled jobs, live
   websockets) keep a machine awake — a gateway registered as a preview
   service counts. Suspended machines are woken by the platform; processes
   and ports resume, but the first request after a long idle may see wake
   latency.
2. **Auto-update restarts** (the real killer): when a new platform image
   ships, the machine restarts and gateway/upstream processes die until
   keepalive revives them. Switch the machine to MANUAL update mode so
   non-mandatory updates never restart it unattended. Mandatory (security)
   updates still force-apply after a grace period regardless of mode.

Check the current mode from inside the machine (read-only, no extra auth
setup — these env vars are preset in every machine):

    curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTAINER_JWT" \
      "$AI_AGENT_API_URL/api/cloud/internal/machines/$FLY_MACHINE_ID/update-mode"
    # → {"update_mode": "auto" | "manual"}

Agents can also SET the mode for their own machine (container JWT, scoped —
writing another machine's id returns 403):

    curl -s -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTAINER_JWT" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"update_mode":"manual"}' \

    # → {"update_mode": "manual"}   (or "auto" to re-enable)

Publish flow requirement: after listing a paid service, read the mode — if
"auto", recommend switching to manual and, WITH the user's confirmation,
flip it via the PUT above (never switch silently). The web dashboard toggle
(`PUT /containers/{id}/update-preference`, user JWT) remains available. In
manual mode the web UI shows a banner when an update is pending; mandatory
updates still force-apply after the grace period (keepalive then restores
the service after the restart).
