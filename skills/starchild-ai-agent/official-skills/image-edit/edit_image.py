"""Image editing script — edit, enhance, and transform existing images.

Supports three models:
  - nano2    (fal-ai/gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview/edit)     — fastest ~15s, good for drafts
  - nanopro  (fal-ai/gemini-3-pro-image-preview/edit)   — balanced ~25s, good quality (default)
  - gpt      (openai/gpt-image-2/edit)       — best quality, slow ~150s

Covers: general editing, background replacement, upscaling, restoration,
colorization, inpainting, retouching, beauty enhancement, filters,
car customization, before/after comparison, outpainting, and more.

Flow: resolve image → build prompt → submit to fal queue → poll → download.

Cost tracking: uses _cost_track.py to record per-call costs via sc-proxy
headers so the agent's per-turn cost_summary picks up this skill's cost.

Local testing: set FAL_KEY env var to call fal.ai directly (no sc-proxy).

    """Edit an existing image using AI models.

    This is the primary function for all image editing operations.
    Requires at least one image input (local path or URL).
    Supports up to 3 images for multi-image scenarios (blend, face swap,
    style transfer, group photo composition).

    Args:
        image_path: Local workspace file path to the source image.
        image_url: Public HTTPS URL of the source image.
        image2_path: Local path to a second image (for blend, face swap,
            style transfer, etc.).
        image2_url: Public URL of a second image.
        image3_path: Local path to a third image (for group photos, etc.).
        image3_url: Public URL of a third image.
        prompt: Editing instruction describing the desired changes.
        action: Operation type — one of the ACTIONS keys:
            edit, blend, extend, local_edit, text_render, multi_angle,
            before_after, replace_bg, upscale, restore, colorize,
            remove_person, retouch, slim, enhance, filter,
            comparison, car_color, car_wrap.
        model: Model key — "nanopro" (default, fast ~25s) or
            "gpt" (best quality ~150s).
        count: Number of output images to generate (1-4, default 1).
            Uses fal.ai native num_images for efficient batch generation.
        aspect_ratio: Output aspect ratio (1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 9:16, 16:9).
            None = preserve original image dimensions.
        output_format: Output image format — "png" (default), "jpeg", or "webp".

    Returns:
        dict with success status, edited image paths, and metadata.
