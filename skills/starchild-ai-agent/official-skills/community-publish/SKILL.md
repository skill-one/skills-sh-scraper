## Two concepts: PUBLISH vs LIST — never confuse them

This skill handles two fundamentally different concepts. Mixing them up is the #1 source of wrong answers.

| Concept | What it means | Functions |
|---|---|---|
| **PUBLISH (发布)** | Make something **accessible** — a URL works, or code is on GitHub | `publish_preview`, `unpublish_preview`, `list_published_previews`, `open_source`, `remove_open_source`, `list_open_source`, `get_open_source`, `fork`, `validate_open_source` |
| **LIST (上架)** | Make something **discoverable/purchasable** on the marketplace | Free: `list_in_dashboard`, `unlist_from_dashboard`, `delete_listing`, `get_listing_status`<br>Paid: `create_paid_service`, `submit_for_review`, `get_review_status`, `publish_service`, `unpublish_service`, `list_my_services`, `get_service`, `update_service`, `delete_service`, `restore_service`<br>Cover: `upload_cover_image`<br>Browse + consumer: `explore_services`, `get_service_detail`, `get_service_pricing`, `get_service_reviews`, `write_service_review`, `favorite_service`, `unfavorite_service`, `get_favorite_services`, `get_user_services`, `get_service_earnings`, `get_earnings_summary`, `get_service_tags`, `get_featured_services`<br>Projects query: `explore_projects`, `my_projects`, `favorite_projects`, `get_tab_counts`, `get_popular_tags`, `get_user_projects`, `favorite_project`, `unfavorite_project` |

**Publishing does NOT auto-list.** `publish_preview()` only allocates the URL. `open_source()` only pushes code. Neither makes the project discoverable on the marketplace — that requires a separate, deliberate LIST call.

### Listing has two flows

| Flow | When to use | Review? | Pricing? | Functions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Free listing** | Free project, show on `/projects` gallery | No | No | `list_in_dashboard()` |
| **Paid listing** | Charge for access via x402 | Required (6-check review, must pass before publishing) | Yes (USDC/USDG/USDC(Solana) on platform networks — default Base+Monad+Robinhood+X Layer+Solana, follows `all`) | `create_paid_service()` → `submit_for_review()` (required) → `publish_service()` |

> **`POST /api/services` no longer accepts `service_type: "free_project"`.** Free listing is done by `list_in_dashboard()` (the project gallery flow). Paid listing uses `create_paid_service()` + review + publish (the service API flow).

### Limited-time free promo ≠ this skill

After a **paid** service is listed, the owner may run a **time-window free promotion**
(`free_promo_start` / `free_promo_end`). That is **not** marketplace listing work and is
**not** implemented here.

| Concept | What it is | Where |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Free **listing** | Free project on `/projects` gallery | this skill → `list_in_dashboard()` |
| `free_trial_count` | N free calls before charge (pay_per_use only) | this skill → `create_paid_service(..., free_trial_count=N)` |
| **Limited-time free promo** | Calendar window: amount-0 verify, no settle/debit | **x402 skill** → `skills/x402/references/selling.md` section **Limited-time free promotion** |

If the user asks to “开限时免费 / free promo / free for N days” on an already-paid listing:
read the **x402** skill (self-check P1–P5, then PUT free-promo). Do **not** invent APIs in
community-publish or confuse it with `free_trial_count`.

---

## Visibility model — read this before answering "can others see it?"

A project's "publicness" is **three orthogonal switches**, not one:

| Switch | Off state | On state | Flipped by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **URL access** | Visiting the URL returns 404 | URL works for anyone who has the link | `publish_preview` / `unpublish_preview` |
| **Gallery discoverability** | Not on `/projects` gallery | Appears in the gallery | `list_in_dashboard` / `unlist_from_dashboard` |
| **Marketplace listing** | Not on the Service Marketplace | Discoverable + purchasable | `create_paid_service` + `publish_service` / `unpublish_service` |

A project can be in any combination. Never collapse these into "is it public yet".

**Status questions are read-only operations.** Whenever the user asks:
- "is it visible / public / discoverable yet?"
- "上架了吗 / 在 dashboard 上吗 / 别人能看到吗"
- "is the listing live?"

The authoritative answer comes ONLY from a fresh `get_listing_status(slug)` (free) or `get_review_status(service_id)` (paid) call. Do NOT infer from past actions.

---

## Project types — three only

| type | What it is | Eligible for `publish_preview()`? |
|---|---|---|
| `task` | Scheduled cron/interval job | No (no HTTP port) |
| `service` | Long-running HTTP service (dashboard, API, page) | **Yes** |
| `script` | One-shot script | No (no HTTP port) |

---

## Routing — match user intent to the right action

### A. Status intents — user wants to know current state

| Sample phrasing | Action |
|---|---|
| "is it visible / public / discoverable / live?" | `get_listing_status(slug)` |
| "上架了吗 / 在 dashboard 上吗 / 别人能不能看到" | `get_listing_status(slug)` |
| "what URLs do I have published?" / "我发布了哪些" | `list_published_previews()` |
| "what's open-sourced?" / "都有哪些开源代码" | `list_open_source(...)` |
| "我的服务" / "my services" / "我的付费服务" | `list_my_services()` |
| "审核状态" / "审核通过了吗" / "review status" | `get_review_status(service_id)` |

### B. Action intents — user wants to change state

| Sample phrasing | Action | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| "publish" / "share" / "make public" / "公开" / "发布" (no qualifier) | `publish_preview(preview_id)` | Allocates the URL only. Listing is NOT auto-flipped. |
| "list on the dashboard" / "上架" / "show on community" / "make discoverable" / "发到广场" | `list_in_dashboard(slug)` | Free listing. Requires the preview to already exist. |
| "上架付费服务" / "make this a paid service" / "上架到服务市场（付费）" | `create_paid_service(...)` → `submit_for_review()` (recommended) → `publish_service()` | Paid listing. Needs x402 config first. |
| "publish AND list" / "发布并上架" | `publish_preview()` THEN `list_in_dashboard()` | Two separate calls in order. |
| "remove from dashboard" / "下架" / "unlist" / "hide from gallery" | `unlist_from_dashboard(slug)` | Free listing only. Soft-unlist (sets `is_public=false`, `review_status='unlisted'`, preserves stats). Preview URL stays alive. |
| "下架付费服务" / "unpublish service" | `unpublish_service(service_id)` | Paid listing only. |
| "open source" / "open-source the code" / "开源代码" | `open_source(project_dir)` | Pushes code to GitHub. Does NOT list. |
| "unpublish the URL" / "take down the link" / "停止服务" | `unpublish_preview(slug)` | Stops the preview container service only. Does NOT affect listing state (`is_public`/`review_status` unchanged). URL becomes inaccessible (404). |
| "remove the open source" / "delete from GitHub" | `remove_open_source(slug)` | |
| "fork" / "install someone's project" | `fork(source)` | |
| "提交审核" / "submit for review" | `submit_for_review(service_id)` | Paid only. Required — must pass before publishing |
| "发布服务" / "publish my service" | `publish_service(service_id)` | Paid only, requires approved or unlisted state |
| "更新服务" / "update service" | `update_service(service_id, ...)` | Paid only |
| "删除服务" / "delete service" | `delete_service(service_id)` | Paid only |
| "删除项目" / "delete listing" / "permanently remove from marketplace" | `delete_listing(slug)` | Free listing only. Permanently deletes the listing row AND the `community_slugs` record. URL becomes inaccessible (404). Removes from both explore and my-projects. Use `unlist_from_dashboard()` to hide without deleting. |
| Ambiguous after rereading | Ask one question | "你是要 (a) 发布公开 URL，(b) 免费上架到广场，(c) 付费上架到服务市场，还是 (d) 开源代码？" |

## Cross-link via `publisher:` binding

When the same project has BOTH a public URL AND open-sourced code, you want them paired so the frontend renders "View Source" on the listing card and "Visit Live Demo" on the code card. This skill drives that pairing through one explicit binding in project.yaml.

### How to declare the binding

Add a `publisher:` block to `project.yaml`:

```yaml
name: my-app
type: service
version: 1.0.0
publisher:
  code_slug: my-app               # OPTIONAL — defaults to manifest.name
  public_slug: my-app-pub         # OPTIONAL — URL suffix; defaults to code_slug
```

Both fields are optional. If omitted, both default to `manifest.name`.

### Either side can be published first

The gateway holds a pending entry until the second side arrives. **No ordering requirement**, no manual link step.

| Order | What happens |
|---|---|
| `open_source` first → `publish_preview` second | open_source records pending entry; publish_preview consumes it and links |
| `publish_preview` first → `open_source` second | publish_preview records pending entry (needs `publisher_code_slug` arg); open_source consumes it and links |

### Manual repair (rare)

If a pairing was wired wrong (e.g. after a rename), use:

```python
link_to_listing(listing_slug="2004-my-app-pub", code_slug="my-app")
```

## PUBLISH: `publish_preview()` — public URL

`publish_preview(preview_id, slug="", title="", publisher_code_slug="")`

Map a running service to `https://community.iamstarchild.com/{user_id}-{slug}`.

- `preview_id`: from `preview(action='serve')`. Must be `status=running`.
- `slug`: URL suffix only (lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens, 3-50 chars). User_id prefix is added automatically.
- `title`: display name for the listing.
- `publisher_code_slug`: optional cross-link binding to a code project's slug.

Returns `{"ok": True, "url": "...", "publisher": {...}, "hint": "...",
"x402_detected": bool}` — plus a `next_step` warning when `x402_detected`
is true (complete the paid-listing chain).

**Constraints:**
- **`publish_preview` does NOT create a paid listing.** If the endpoint
  charges via x402 (returns 402), the publish flow is INCOMPLETE until you
  also run `create_paid_service` → `submit_for_review` (recommended) → `publish_service`
  — otherwise the marketplace shows nothing or "free". The return value
  flags this (`x402_detected: true` + `next_step`) when billing is detected.
- Max 20 published previews per user (gateway returns 429 over).
- Service must be running. Stops working when the container goes down.
- Only works inside the Starchild Fly container (needs `FLY_MACHINE_ID`).
- **Listing visibility default is `is_public=false`.** A successful `publish_preview` allocates the URL but does NOT make it discoverable. Discovery requires a separate `list_in_dashboard()` call.

**Companions:**
- `unpublish_preview(slug)` — stop the preview container service. URL becomes inaccessible (404). Does NOT affect listing state (`is_public`/`review_status` unchanged).
- `list_published_previews()` — all currently published preview URLs for this user.

---

## PUBLISH: `open_source()` — push code to GitHub

`open_source(project_dir, version_bump="patch", message="")`

Push project source to `community-projects/projects/{user_id}/{slug}/` on GitHub.

- `project_dir`: e.g. `output/projects/my-task`
- `version_bump`: `patch` | `minor` | `major` | `none`
- `message`: commit message body describing what this version changed.
  **You (the agent) should always compose this** based on the actual code
  changes you made in this session — never leave it blank if you know
  what changed. Aim for one to three short lines describing the user-visible
  change.

**This is a PUBLISH action only — it does NOT list anything on the marketplace.**
To make a project discoverable, call `list_in_dashboard()` (free) or
`create_paid_service()` (paid) separately after publishing.

**Companions:**
- `fork(source, dest_dir=None)` — install someone else's open-sourced project locally
- `list_open_source(type=None, tag=None, user=None, q=None)` — browse the GitHub catalog
- `get_open_source(source)` — fetch one project's full metadata
- `remove_open_source(slug)` — delete project directory from GitHub catalog (owner only)
- `validate_open_source(project_dir)` — pre-flight check before publishing

### Project structure

Every project under `output/projects/{slug}/`:

```
project.yaml      # metadata (name, version, type, env_required, sc_proxy, publisher)
PROJECT.md        # required sections: What / Required env / How to start / Outputs / Troubleshooting
.env.example      # all env vars with placeholder values
.gitignore        # secrets blacklist
src/
  ├── run.py       # for type=task (must start: # -*- task-system: v3 -*-)
  ├── index.html   # for type=service (or app.py + frontend)
  └── main.py      # for type=script
```

---

## LIST (FREE): `list_in_dashboard()` — show on /projects gallery

`list_in_dashboard(slug, name=None, description="", cover_url=None, tags=None)`

Make a published preview discoverable in the public gallery at `https://community.iamstarchild.com/projects`. Without this, the preview URL works but is invisible to anyone who doesn't already know it.

- `slug`: the **full** slug returned by `publish_preview()` (i.e. `{user_id}-{suffix}`).
- `name`: gallery card display name. Defaults to `slug`.
- `description`: ≤500 chars.
- `cover_url`: must be on `storage.googleapis.com`, `image.thum.io`, or `api.microlink.io`. **To upload a user-provided image, call `upload_cover_image(slug, file_path)` first** — it handles presign → GCS upload → returns the public URL. See [Cover Image Upload](#cover-image-upload-flow) below.
- `tags`: ≤5 tags, ≤20 chars each.

Returns `{"ok": True, "listing": {...}, "url": "...", "dashboard_url": "..."}`.

**Constraints:**
- Requires `publish_preview()` to have run first for the same slug — returns 404 otherwise.
- Idempotent: calling again with different name/tags updates the existing listing.
- No review, no pricing — this is the free listing flow.

**Companions:**
- `unlist_from_dashboard(slug)` — soft-unlist from gallery (sets `is_public=false`, `review_status='unlisted'`, preserves view/favorite counts). URL stays alive. To re-list, call `list_in_dashboard()` again.
- `delete_listing(slug)` — permanently delete the listing row AND the `community_slugs` record (removes view/favorite counts). URL becomes inaccessible (404). Removes from both explore and my-projects. Use `unlist_from_dashboard()` to hide without deleting.
- `get_listing_status(slug)` — read-only check: returns `{ok, exists, is_public, listing}`.

## LIST (PAID): Paid service listing on the Service Marketplace

Paid services charge for access via x402 (on-chain USDC/USDG settlement on the platform's enabled networks — by default Base + Monad + Robinhood + X Layer + Solana, following the `all` mode). An automated 6-check review is required before publishing — the service must pass all checks (approved) before `publish_service()` will work. API call examples are optional but recommended.

#### Multi-chain payment networks (plans-280)

Every paid service has a **networks_mode** that decides which chains buyers can pay on:

| `networks_mode` | Behavior | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `"all"` (default) | Accept payment on **all platform mainnets** (currently Base + Monad + Robinhood + X Layer + Solana; new chains are picked up automatically with no code change). The gateway stores `supported_networks` as NULL and expands it at read time. | The common case — pass nothing or `networks_mode="all"`. |
| `"custom"` | Accept payment **only** on the chains listed in `supported_networks` (a non-empty list of CAIP-2 ids, e.g. `["eip155:8453"]`). Does NOT follow platform expansion. | The user explicitly says "only Base" / "only Monad" / a specific subset. |

**Rules:**
- **Default is `all`.** Never hard-code a single chain like `['eip155:8453']` as the default — that re-introduces the old Base-only behavior.
- `custom` requires a non-empty `supported_networks`; an empty list is rejected.
- `provider_wallet` is an **EVM address used on every enabled chain** (the Starchild facilitator settles to the same address on each chain). It is NOT Base-only.
- Buyers see the 402 `accepts` array (one entry per enabled chain, same price) and **pick one chain per payment** — this is standard x402 multi-accepts, not a protocol change.
- Gas for settlement is paid by the platform (Starchild facilitator), not the provider.
- To switch an existing service back to `all`: `update_service(service_id, networks_mode="all")`.
- To restrict to a subset: `update_service(service_id, networks_mode="custom", supported_networks=["eip155:8453"])`.

This aligns with the **x402 skill's `monetize`** default (`all`). The two skills are on the same release train — if the gateway 402 `accepts` and the marketplace listing show different chains, one side was configured `custom` while the other stayed `all`.

### Service lifecycle & review states (review is ADVISORY)

```
  create ──▶ published ──▶ submit_for_review ─▶ pending ─▶ approved / rejected
                │            (required before publishing — must pass to go live)
                │                                    │ fix via update_service(), re-check
                ▼                                    ▼
           publish_service() ─────────────────▶ listed ◀─▶ unlisted (owner takedown / re-list)
                                                     │
                                                     ▼
                                          unavailable ──▶ restore ──▶ listed
```

Review is a **self-check, not a gate**: `submit_for_review()` runs 5 automated
checks (api_reachable, pricing_consistency, x402_payment, response_match,
doc_completeness, examples_provided) and stores a report for the owner.
`publish_service()` requires the service to be in `approved` state (or `unlisted`
for re-listing). **The review must pass before publishing** — run
`submit_for_review()` first so a
broken endpoint is caught before buyers can pay for it. A `rejected` report does NOT block listing; a check run against an
already-`listed` service never delists it.

### ⚡ Scenario Selection Decision Tree — MUST follow before creating any paid service

**Step 1: Does the service have a Starchild project page (published via `publish_preview()`)?**
- **YES, and the page is free to browse** → Flow D. Use `service_type="paid_project"` + `project_slug`. The free page is published via `publish_preview()`, and the paid API sits behind x402 on `/api/*` routes. The upstream app serves the free intro page at `/` and the paid API at `/api/*`.
- **YES, but the entire page requires payment** → Flow B (Form 1). Use `service_type="paid_project"` + `project_slug`. The user implements their own access control (paywall + credential validation). See the x402 skill's "Paid Project: two forms" section.
- **NO (standalone API, no project page)** → Flow C or E. Use `service_type="paid_api"` WITHOUT `project_slug`. Do NOT create an index.html or publish a preview — there is no free page. The public URL root will show the x402 402 challenge or gateway info.

**Step 2: Does the user want multiple API endpoints at different prices?**
- **YES** → Use `api_endpoints` array in ONE `create_paid_service()` call (Flow E). Do NOT create multiple separate services.
- **NO** → Single endpoint, use `api_endpoint` only.

**Step 3: Combine the answers:**

| User wants | Free page? | Multi-endpoint? | Flow | service_type | project_slug | api_endpoints |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| Paid subscription project (entire site behind paywall) | YES | NO | B | `paid_project` | required | — |
| Standalone paid API (no webpage) | NO | NO | C | `paid_api` | **omit** | — |
| Free intro page + paid API | YES | NO | D | `paid_project` | required | — |
| Free intro page + multiple paid APIs | YES | YES | D+E | `paid_project` | required | required |
| Multiple paid APIs (no webpage) | NO | YES | E | `paid_api` | **omit** | required |

### ⚠️ Common Flow confusion mistakes (from real incidents)

| Mistake | What goes wrong | Correct action |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| User says "write an intro page AND a paid API" but agent uses `paid_api` + creates a separate project preview | Service and project are disconnected — marketplace shows two items, one free (blank) and one paid | Use `paid_project` + `project_slug` (Flow D). The intro page and API are ONE service. |
| User says "pure paid API" but agent creates an index.html and publishes a preview | Unnecessary free project page clutters the marketplace; the intro page may show blank/JSON | Do NOT create index.html or publish_preview. Use `paid_api` (Flow C). The x402 gateway's 402 response IS the API's self-description. |
| User says "multiple API endpoints" but agent creates N separate services | N marketplace cards instead of 1; port conflicts; upstream confusion | Create ONE service with `api_endpoints` array (Flow E). |
| Agent reuses an upstream port already taken by another service | Gateway proxies to the WRONG upstream — responses are from a different service | Each service MUST have a unique upstream port. Check `.x402/services.json` for conflicts. |
| Agent creates start.py with `/docs` route that conflicts with upstream's `/docs` | Flask `AssertionError: View function mapping is overwriting an existing endpoint` | Do NOT define `/`, `/docs`, or `/index.html` routes in both start.py and the upstream app — define them in only one place. |

**Key rules:**
- **Do NOT pass `project_slug` for standalone paid APIs.** `project_slug` belongs to `paid_project` only — including the "free webpage + paid API" pattern (Flow D, which uses `paid_project`). Passing a preview slug or a non-existent slug for a standalone `paid_api` creates a phantom association — the backend will silently clear it, but you should not have passed it in the first place.
- **Routing rule: service tied to a project page → `paid_project`; `paid_api` is ONLY for standalone APIs with no project page.** If your API has a published Starchild project (landing page/dashboard) that users can browse for free, use `service_type="paid_project"` + `project_slug` — this merges the service into the project card in the marketplace. If there is NO free project page, use `paid_api` and do NOT set `project_slug`. Passing `paid_api` + `project_slug` is auto-upgraded to `paid_project` by `create_paid_service()` (with a `project_slug_warning` in the response) — the final listing is always `paid_project`.
- `project_slug` must be the **full published slug WITH user prefix** (e.g. `33-my-app`), and must correspond to an existing row in `project_listings` (i.e. `publish_preview()` + `list_in_dashboard()` must have been called first).
- `api_endpoints` is for services with multiple endpoints at different prices; each endpoint has its own `path`, `price`, and optional `label`.
- A project with `project_slug` set will NOT appear in the "Free" tab — it moves to "All" and "Paid" tabs.
- **Merged-into-project-card visibility:** when a listed service has `project_slug` pointing to a PUBLIC project, it is folded into that project's card in unified marketplace views. Consequence: the service will NOT appear as a standalone item in `explore_services()` or `list_my_services()` — this is by design, not a listing failure. It is still live and purchasable via the project card, `get_service(service_id)`, and `get_user_services(user_id)`, and it IS discoverable via `explore_marketplace()` (unified feed). To verify a merged service is listed, check `get_service()` → `review_status == "listed"`, not `explore_services()` results.
- **When the user asks for multiple APIs, create ONE service with `api_endpoints`** — do NOT create multiple separate services. See Flow E.

### Tagging — predefined tag slugs for marketplace filtering

When creating a paid service, pass `tags` with 1-3 tag slugs from the predefined list below. The agent should choose the most relevant tags based on the service's name and description. Tags are used for marketplace filtering and discovery — they replace the old `category` field.

**Predefined tag slugs** (pick 1-3 most relevant):

| Domain | Tags |
|--------|------|
| DeFi & Trading | `defi`, `trading`, `dex`, `dex-swap`, `lending`, `lending-yield`, `yield`, `staking`, `derivatives`, `bridge` |
| On-chain Data | `onchain-data`, `token-analytics`, `price-feed`, `wallet`, `wallet-portfolio`, `nft` |
| AI & ML | `ai-inference`, `llm-inference`, `text-analysis`, `image-generation`, `text-to-speech`, `video-transcription`, `translation` |

### Flow B — Paid Project listing

A paid project charges for access. There are two forms — both use
`service_type="paid_project"` + `project_slug`:

**Form 1: Entire page behind paywall** — the page itself requires payment.
The user implements their own access control (a login-like component with
credential validation). The platform provides the x402 payment protocol;
the user implements the paywall UI and credential logic. See the x402
skill's "Paid Project: two forms" section for implementation details and
the "How to pay with Agent" documentation template.

**Form 2: Free page + paid API** — the page is free to browse, API calls
cost money. This is Flow D (below). The upstream app serves the free intro
page at `/` and the paid API at `/api/*`.

Both forms are the same pattern — the only difference is what the user
implements (paywall interceptor for Form 1, nothing extra for Form 2).

1. **Have a running project** with a public URL (via `publish_preview()`).
2. **Configure x402 charging** on the project's access endpoint using the **x402 skill**.
   The endpoint must return `402 Payment Required` when unpaid, and `200` + data after payment.
3. **Create the service record:**

```python
create_paid_service(
    name="Premium Trading Signals",
    description="Real-time trading signals with on-chain confirmation.",
    service_type="paid_project",
    tags=["trading", "onchain-data"],
    project_slug="33-premium-signals",  # FULL published slug WITH user prefix (the URL path segment)
    api_endpoint="https://community.iamstarchild.com/33-premium-signals",
    provider_wallet="0xAbC...yourEvmWallet",  # EVM address for Base/Monad/Robinhood/X Layer; Solana address auto-fetched from Privy wallet
    pricing_model="monthly",
    price=10,
    service_description="Subscribers get a dashboard with live trading signals.",
)
```

   Required paid-project fields: `name`, `description`, `service_type`,
   `project_slug`, `api_endpoint`, `provider_wallet`, `pricing_model`, `price`,
   `service_description`. Recommended: `tags` (1-3 predefined tag slugs for marketplace filtering).

   ⚠️ `project_slug` must be the **full published slug including the user prefix**
   (e.g. `33-premium-signals`, exactly the path segment in the project URL
   `https://community.iamstarchild.com/<slug>/`). The gateway derives the API
   endpoint as `publicUrl + "/" + project_slug` when `api_endpoint` is not set,
   so an unprefixed or wrong slug breaks endpoint derivation and the
   project↔service association. Fix an existing record with
   `update_service(service_id, project_slug="<full-slug>")` — no re-listing needed.

4. **Required: run the automated review** — paid services must pass review
   before they can be published. A broken endpoint listed on the marketplace
   can take buyers' money before you notice:

```python
submit_for_review(service_id)   # kicks off 6 automated checks asynchronously
get_review_status(service_id)   # poll until no longer pending, then show the
                                # report to the user — THEY decide what to fix
```

   A `rejected` report blocks publishing. Read `review_feedback` +
   `latest_task.checks`, fix with `update_service()`, and
   re-run `submit_for_review()` until approved.

5. **Publish** once the review passes (approved):

```python
publish_service(service_id)
```

   The check can also be run again later against a listed service — it never
   delists it.

### Flow C — Paid API listing

A paid API is an external API service that already implements x402 charging.

> **⚠️ Do NOT pass `project_slug` for standalone paid APIs.**
> `project_slug` is ONLY for `paid_project` (required) or the "free webpage + paid API"
> pattern (Flow D, where a published Starchild project page exists). For a standalone
> `paid_api` with no associated free project page, omit `project_slug` entirely.
> The backend validates `project_slug` against `project_listings` and silently clears
> non-existent slugs, but you should not pass it in the first place.
>
> **⚠️ Choose `paid_project` if the API belongs to a published Starchild project.**
> If your API has a landing page / dashboard published via `publish_preview()` (i.e. it
> exists as a project on community.iamstarchild.com), use `service_type="paid_project"`
> + `project_slug=<full published slug WITH user prefix>` (Flow B) — NOT `paid_api`. The `project_slug` is what
> links the service to the project card (pricing badge, cross-navigation). A `paid_api`
> listing has no project association, so the project card will keep showing "Free".
> Use `paid_api` only for truly external/standalone APIs with no Starchild project.
> Forgot the link? `update` the service record with `project_slug` — no need to re-list.

1. **Have an x402-enabled API** — the endpoint must return `402` when unpaid and `200` + data
   after a valid `X-PAYMENT` header. Use the **x402 skill** to implement this if needed.

   #### Ensuring purchases are recorded by Starchild

   For the Starchild marketplace to track purchases, earnings, and usage stats,
   choose one of the two approaches below based on your facilitator setup:

   **Option A — Use the Starchild facilitator (recommended)**

   Set your x402 middleware's facilitator URL to:

   ```
   https://starchild-x402-facilitator.fly.dev
   ```

   On successful settle, the Starchild facilitator automatically calls back
   community-gateway to record the purchase. No extra setup needed — proceed
   to step 2 with the default `create_paid_service()` call.

   **Option B — Use your own facilitator + proxy mode**

   If you use your own facilitator (or a third-party one), Starchild cannot
   receive settlement callbacks. Instead, pass `source="manual"` when creating
   the service record (step 2):

   ```python
   create_paid_service(
       ...,
       source="manual",   # ← enables proxy mode
   )
   ```

   This tells the marketplace to generate a **proxy URL** for your API:

   ```
   https://community.iamstarchild.com/proxy/{service_id}/...
   ```

   Users access your API through this proxy URL. The proxy transparently
   forwards requests to your real `api_endpoint` and, on successful payment
   (HTTP 200 with a `payment-signature` header), automatically records the
   purchase in Starchild's database. You do NOT need to change your facilitator
   URL or set up any callbacks.

   **402 response requirements** (checked during review):

   - The `402` response body **must** include a `pricingModel` field (platform format).
   - `payTo` **must** be your actual receiving EVM wallet address (used on every enabled chain).
   - The `accepts` array contains one entry per enabled chain (multi-accepts); buyers pick one chain per payment. Each entry has the same `amount` (USDC, 6 decimals) — the platform does not support per-chain pricing in this release.
   - The response must be a valid x402 challenge that clients can parse.

2. **Create the service record** (`service_type = "paid_api"`):

```python
create_paid_service(
    name="On-chain Whale Tracker API",
    description="REST API returning real-time whale wallet movements across 12 chains.",
    service_type="paid_api",
    tags=["onchain-data", "wallet-portfolio", "trading"],
    api_endpoint="https://api.example.com/v1/whales",
    provider_wallet="0xAbC...yourEvmWallet",  # EVM address for Base/Monad/Robinhood/X Layer; Solana address auto-fetched from Privy wallet
    pricing_model="pay_per_use",
    price=0.01,
    free_trial_count=3,
    api_documentation="# Whale Tracker API\n\n## GET /v1/whales\n\nReturns recent whale transactions.\n\n### Parameters\n| name | type | required | description |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| chain | string | no | Filter by chain id (default: all) |\n| limit | int | no | Max results (default: 50, max: 200) |\n\n### Response\n```json\n[{\"hash\":\"0x...\",\"from\":\"0x...\",\"to\":\"0x...\",\"value\":\"1000000\",\"token\":\"USDC\",\"chain\":\"base\",\"ts\":1700000000}]\n```",
    example_request="curl https://api.example.com/v1/whales?chain=base&limit=10",
    example_response='[{"hash":"0xabc...","from":"0x111...","to":"0x222...","value":"5000000","token":"USDC","chain":"base","ts":1700000000}]',
)
```

   Required paid-API fields: `name`, `description`, `service_type`, `api_endpoint`,
   `provider_wallet`, `pricing_model`, `price`, `api_documentation`.
   Recommended (optional): `example_request`, `example_response` (improves buyer experience).
   Optional: `free_trial_count` (only for `pay_per_use`),
   `source` (`"manual"` for proxy mode — see step 1 Option B above; omit for default
   Starchild facilitator mode),
   `cover_url` (custom cover image URL — must be on `storage.googleapis.com` or other
   allowed domains; if not provided, the agent should auto-generate a suitable cover
   image based on the service name and description, upload it via the image upload
   service, and pass the resulting URL).

   #### Cover image for paid services

   Paid services do NOT auto-generate a cover image (unlike free projects which get
   auto-captured screenshots). Pass `cover_url` in `create_paid_service()` — must be on
   `storage.googleapis.com` (or `image.thum.io` / `api.microlink.io`).

   **⚠️ MANDATORY: When the user provides an image or you need to set a cover, call
   `upload_cover_image(slug, file_path)`.** This function handles the full flow:
   presign URL → compress → upload to GCS → return `storage.googleapis.com` public URL.
   Do NOT use imgur, data URIs, or any other hosting — the gateway validates the domain.

   If the user does not provide an image, generate one (e.g. using an image generation
   skill), save it locally, then call `upload_cover_image()`.

   You can also use `update_service(cover_url=...)` later to change the cover.

   See [Cover Image Upload](#cover-image-upload-flow) for the complete reference.

3. **Run review** → same as Flow B step 4 (required before publishing).
4. **Publish** → same as Flow B step 5 (requires approved status).

### Flow D — Free Webpage + Paid API (hybrid)

Your project has a free landing page (published via `publish_preview()`) AND a paid API
endpoint. Users can browse the project page for free, but API calls cost money.
The marketplace shows a single merged card with both "Visit Project" and "Call API" buttons.

1. **Publish the project** via `publish_preview()` — this creates the free landing page.
2. **Configure x402 charging** on the API endpoint (e.g. `/api/random` returns 402).
3. **Create the service record** with `service_type="paid_project"` + `project_slug`:

```python
create_paid_service(
    name="Random9 API",
    description="Random 9-digit number API. Free docs page + paid API calls.",
    service_type="paid_project",
    tags=["developer-tools"],
    project_slug="33-random9-api",  # FULL slug WITH user prefix — links to the free project page
    api_endpoint="https://community.iamstarchild.com/33-random9-api/api/random",
    provider_wallet="0xAbC...yourEvmWallet",  # EVM address for Base/Monad/Robinhood/X Layer; Solana address auto-fetched from Privy wallet
    pricing_model="pay_per_use",
    price=0.01,
    service_description="Paid access to the Random9 API endpoint; the docs page stays free.",  # required for paid_project
    api_documentation="# Random9 API\n## GET /api/random\nReturns a random 9-digit number.",
    example_request="curl https://community.iamstarchild.com/33-random9-api/api/random",
    example_response='{"random":"482917365","digits":9}',
)
```

   The `project_slug` merges this service into the project card. The project page (`/`)
   stays free; only the API endpoint (`/api/random`) requires payment.

   > Note: if `service_type="paid_api"` is passed together with `project_slug`,
   > `create_paid_service()` auto-upgrades it to `paid_project` and returns a
   > `project_slug_warning` — the stored listing is always `paid_project`. Passing
   > `paid_project` directly (as above) is the canonical form.

4. **Publish + optional self-check** — same as Flow B steps 4–5.

### Flow E — Multi-Endpoint API

Your service has multiple API endpoints at different prices (e.g. basic $0.01, premium $0.10).
Each endpoint is listed separately in the marketplace detail view.

> **⚠️ When the user asks for multiple APIs, create ONE service with `api_endpoints` — NOT multiple separate services.**
> For example, if the user says "develop three paid APIs and list them", do NOT call
> `create_paid_service()` three times. Instead, create a single service with an
> `api_endpoints` array containing all three endpoints. This gives users a unified
> marketplace card where they can see and purchase individual endpoints.
> Only create multiple services if the APIs are truly unrelated (different domains,
> different audiences, different pricing models).

1. **Configure x402 charging** with per-route pricing:
   ```bash
   # Default networks_mode is "all" (Base + Monad). Omit --networks to follow
   # the platform mainnet set; pass --networks eip155:8453 only if the user
   # explicitly wants to restrict to a single chain.
   python3 skills/x402/scripts/monetize.py --name my-api --upstream-port 5173 \
     --mode pay_per_use --price 0.01 \
     --route "GET /api/basic=$0.01" --route "GET /api/premium=$0.10" \
     --route "POST /api/batch=$0.50" \
     --facilitator $FAC
   ```

2. **Create the service record** with `api_endpoints`:

```python
create_paid_service(
    name="Data API Service",
    description="Multiple API endpoints at different prices.",
    service_type="paid_api",
    tags=["data-service"],
    api_endpoint="https://example.com/api/basic",  # primary endpoint for review
    api_endpoints=[
        {"path": "GET /api/basic", "price": 0.01, "label": "Basic Query"},
        {"path": "GET /api/premium", "price": 0.10, "label": "Premium Query"},
        {"path": "POST /api/batch", "price": 0.50, "label": "Batch Process"},
    ],
    provider_wallet="0xAbC...yourEvmWallet",  # EVM address for Base/Monad/Robinhood/X Layer; Solana address auto-fetched from Privy wallet
    pricing_model="pay_per_use",
    price=0.01,  # price of the primary/default endpoint
    api_documentation="# Data API\n## GET /api/basic\nBasic data.\n## GET /api/premium\nPremium analytics.",
    example_request="curl https://example.com/api/basic",
    example_response='{"data":"basic market info"}',
)
```

   You can combine Flow D + Flow E: use `service_type="paid_project"` + `project_slug`
   together with `api_endpoints` to link a free project page with multi-endpoint pricing.
   The marketplace shows a merged project card with an endpoint list in the detail view.

3. **Publish + optional self-check** — same as Flow B steps 4–5.

### Review checks (6 automated checks — required for publishing)

`submit_for_review()` runs these checks against the `api_endpoint`; the service must pass all checks to be approved for publishing. A check run against an already-listed service never delists it:

| # | Check | What it verifies |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `api_reachable` | The endpoint returns `402 Payment Required` when no `X-PAYMENT` header is sent |
| 2 | `pricing_consistency` | The `amount` in the 402 response's `accepts` matches the `price` you declared (in USDC base units). With multi-chain `accepts` (one entry per enabled chain), each entry must carry the same `amount` — the platform does not support per-chain pricing in this release. |
| 3 | `x402_payment` | After a valid x402 payment, the endpoint returns `200` + data |
| 4 | `response_match` | The actual response's key fields match your `example_response` |
| 5 | `doc_completeness` | `api_documentation` includes parameter descriptions, response format, and at least one example |

   Check #5 is keyword-matched: the doc must contain a "Response" (or "响应格式")
   section with actual body text under the heading — an empty section fails review.
   `service_description` (paid_project) and `api_documentation` / `example_request` /
   `example_response` (paid_api) are enforced at call time by `create_paid_service()`,
   which errors before creating an unreviewable record.

**Common rejection causes:**
- 402 response `amount` doesn't match declared `price` (off by decimals / wrong unit).
- Endpoint doesn't return 402 at all (x402 not wired up, or returns 200 to unauthenticated requests).
- `example_response` doesn't match what the API actually returns after payment.
- Documentation missing parameter table or response schema.

### Pricing models

All paid services use the x402 `exact` payment scheme (on-chain USDC/USDG settlement on the platform's enabled networks — by default Base + Monad + Robinhood + X Layer + Solana, following `networks_mode="all"`). Gas for settlement is paid by the Starchild facilitator, not the provider.

| `pricing_model` | Meaning | x402 behavior | Typical use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pay_per_use` | Per-call charge | Every request with valid `X-PAYMENT` → settle (charge) | API calls |
| `lifetime` | One-time buyout | First payment settles; subsequent requests verify past settlement, no re-charge | One-time purchases |
| `monthly` | Monthly subscription | Settles once per billing month; re-charge after expiry | Web subscriptions, API monthly plans |
| `weekly` | Weekly subscription | Settles once per 7 days; re-charge after expiry | Short-term subscriptions |
| `quarterly` | Quarterly subscription | Settles once per 90 days; re-charge after expiry | Quarterly plans |
| `yearly` | Yearly subscription | Settles once per 365 days; re-charge after expiry | Annual plans (often discounted) |
| `prepaid` | Prepaid balance | User deposits via `deposit-settle` (one on-chain tx), then each call debits balance off-chain (zero gas) | High-frequency micro-payments |

> `free_trial_count` is only valid for `pay_per_use` — allows N free calls before charging.
> It is **not** a calendar free promo. Time-window free (`free_promo_*`) → **x402** skill
> (`selling.md` → Limited-time free promotion).

#### Multi-plan (multiple pricing options)

A service can offer multiple pricing plans simultaneously (e.g. weekly + monthly + yearly). Pass `pricing_options` array when creating the service:

```python
create_paid_service(
    ...,
    pricing_options=[
        {"pricing_model": "weekly", "price": 3, "is_default": True, "label": "Weekly"},
        {"pricing_model": "monthly", "price": 10, "label": "Monthly"},
        {"pricing_model": "yearly", "price": 90, "label": "Yearly (Save 42%)"},
    ],
)
```

**Rules**:
- `pay_per_use` cannot be combined with other pricing models.
- Subscription models (weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly) can be freely combined.
- `lifetime` and `prepaid` can be combined with subscription models.
- One option must be marked `is_default: True` (or the first is auto-marked).
- The service's `pricing_model` and `price` fields are auto-synced to the default option.

**Multi-plan 402 requirement**: The service's x402 middleware must support the `X-Pricing-Model` header — when a client sends `X-Pricing-Model: yearly`, the 402 response must return the yearly plan's price. Review verifies each plan's 402 amount individually.

**Reference**: See `x402-facilitator/docs/pricing-models.md` for the full specification.

#### Restricting payment to specific chains (custom networks)

The default `networks_mode="all"` follows the platform mainnet set (Base + Monad + Robinhood + X Layer + Solana). Only restrict to a subset when the user explicitly asks for it ("only accept Base", "don't take Monad payments", etc.):

```python
# Create a service that ONLY accepts Base USDC (not Monad)
create_paid_service(
    ...,
    networks_mode="custom",
    supported_networks=["eip155:8453"],   # CAIP-2 chain id; non-empty required
)

# Switch an existing service from all → custom (only Monad)
update_service(service_id, networks_mode="custom", supported_networks=["eip155:143"])

# Switch back to all (follow platform mainnets; clears the custom list)
update_service(service_id, networks_mode="all")
```

**Do NOT default to `custom` + `['eip155:8453']`.** That re-introduces the old Base-only behavior. The default is `all`; only use `custom` when the user explicitly restricts.

---

### Service Examples (API call examples) — recommended but optional

API call examples are **optional but strongly recommended**. They show
buyers what the API returns — appearing as collapsible request/response
pairs on the service detail page. Services without examples will still
pass review, but the review report will note that examples are missing.

**Recommended listing order:**

```
1. create_paid_service(...)                     → creates the service
2. set_service_examples(service_id, examples)   → recommended (improves buyer experience)
3. submit_for_review(service_id)                → required before publishing
4. publish_service(service_id)                  → go live (requires approved)
```

**Adding examples:**

```python
set_service_examples("service-uuid", [
    {
        "title": "Query BTC Price",
        "description": "Get current Bitcoin price in USD",
        "request": 'curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/v1/price?symbol=BTC"',
        "response": '{"symbol": "BTC", "price": 67234.56, "currency": "USD"}'
    },
    {
        "title": "Query ETH Price",
        "request": 'curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/v1/price?symbol=ETH"',
        "response": '{"symbol": "ETH", "price": 3456.78, "currency": "USD"}'
    }
])
```

**Clearing examples** (rarely needed — `set_service_examples` replaces all):

```python
clear_service_examples("service-uuid")
```

**Best practices:**
- Add 2-5 examples covering the most common use cases
- Use descriptive titles that explain the scenario
- Include realistic request parameters and response data
- Show both simple and complex usage patterns
- `set_service_examples()` replaces ALL examples — pass the complete list every time

This supersedes the legacy single `example_request` / `example_response`
fields passed in `create_paid_service()`. Services with legacy fields still
pass the review (backward compatible), but new services should use
`set_service_examples()` for richer multi-scenario demonstrations.

### Paid service management functions

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `create_paid_service(...)` | Create a service record (published state) |
| `set_service_examples(service_id, examples)` | Set API call examples (optional, recommended) — replaces all examples |
| `clear_service_examples(service_id)` | Remove all API call examples |
| `submit_for_review(service_id)` | Run the 6-check automated review (required before publishing) |
| `get_review_status(service_id)` | Poll review progress + per-check details |

Items have `type`: `service` (use `id`) or `project` (paid cards carry `service_id`) — feed into `get_service_detail()` |
| `explore_services(search, sort, tags, ...)` | Browse STANDALONE service items only (services API). ⚠️ Services merged into a public project card do NOT appear here — use `explore_marketplace()` for full coverage |
| `get_service_detail(service_id)` | Public detail for a published service (includes docs, increments views) |
| `get_service_pricing(service_id)` | Verified pricing with real-time x402 check |
| `get_service_reviews(service_id, sort)` | List reviews for a service (public) |
| `write_service_review(service_id, rating, comment)` | Submit/update a review (must have purchased or used first) |

## Behavioral rules

- **Show the diff before `open_source()`**. After `validate_open_source`, summarize what's about to be pushed and ask for confirmation. Exception: explicit "publish without confirmation" or re-publish of a known good project.
- **Never auto-run setup.sh on fork**. Show the command, let the user confirm.
- **Always collect env in one batch on fork**. Read project's `env_required`, diff against `workspace/.env`, call `request_env_input` ONCE with the missing keys.
- **Review is required for publishing.** `publish_service()` requires `approved` status — always run `submit_for_review()` first. Show the report to the user; if rejected, fix with `update_service()` and re-run `submit_for_review()`. A check run against an already-listed service never delists it.
- **`api_endpoint` must be the x402 charge endpoint.** For paid projects this is the project's public URL. For paid APIs it's the external API URL. The reviewer hits this URL expecting a `402`.
- **Price unit is USDC.** The 402 response's `accepts.amount` is in **base units** (6 decimals for USDC). A `$0.01` price → `amount: "10000"`. Mismatch here is the #1 review failure.
- **Don't fabricate review results.** Always call `get_review_status()` to check — never assume the review passed because you submitted it.
- **Don't conflate publish and list.** `publish_preview()` allocates a URL. `list_in_dashboard()` / `create_paid_service()` makes it discoverable. These are separate, deliberate steps.
- **Slug rules**: lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens, 3-50 chars, no leading/trailing hyphen.
- **Version rules** (`open_source`): strict semver. Re-publishing same version is rejected.
- **URL ≠ code ≠ listing**: a public URL going down does NOT remove the open-source code or the marketplace listing, and vice versa. They're independent.
- **Do NOT pass `project_slug` for standalone `paid_api` services.** `project_slug` belongs to `paid_project` only — including the "free webpage + paid API" pattern (Flow D, which uses `paid_project`; passing `paid_api` + `project_slug` gets auto-upgraded to `paid_project` with a `project_slug_warning`). Passing a preview slug or non-existent slug for a standalone API creates a phantom association. The backend silently clears non-existent slugs, but you should not pass `project_slug` unless the user explicitly wants to link a free project page with the paid API.
- **When the user asks for multiple APIs, create ONE service with `api_endpoints`.** Do NOT call `create_paid_service()` multiple times for related APIs. Use the `api_endpoints` array to list all endpoints in a single service (Flow E). Only create multiple services if the APIs are truly unrelated (different domains, different audiences, different pricing models).
- **Default payment networks to `all`.** Never hard-code a single chain (e.g. `['eip155:8453']`) as the default — that re-introduces the old Base-only behavior. Omit `networks_mode` / `supported_networks` (or pass `networks_mode="all"`) so the service follows the platform mainnet set (Base + Monad + Robinhood + X Layer + Solana; new chains picked up automatically). Only use `networks_mode="custom"` + a non-empty `supported_networks` when the user explicitly asks to restrict to a subset ("only Base", "only Monad", etc.).
- **`provider_wallet` is an EVM address used on every enabled EVM chain.** The Starchild facilitator settles to the same address on each EVM chain; it is NOT Base-only. Do not describe it as a "Base wallet" to the user. **For Solana payments**, the platform automatically uses the user's Privy Solana wallet address (`provider_sol_wallet`). If the user has not explicitly provided a Solana address, `create_paid_service()` auto-fetches it from the Privy wallet. Services without a Solana address will not accept Solana payments (Solana is excluded from the 402 accepts list).
- **Gas for settlement is paid by the platform**, not the provider. Do not tell the provider they need to fund ETH/MON for settler gas.

## Common gotchas

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `publish_preview`: `Preview not found` | Wrong preview_id, or service was stopped | Check `/data/previews.json`, restart with `preview(action='serve')` |
| `publish_preview`: `429 Too many published previews` | Hit 20-per-user gateway cap | `unpublish_preview()` something old first |
| `publish_preview`: `FLY_MACHINE_ID not set` | Running locally, not in Starchild container | URL publish only works in the production container |
| `list_in_dashboard`: `404 No preview found` | `publish_preview()` hasn't run for this slug yet | Call `publish_preview()` first |
| `open_source`: `400 Validation failed: env names not in .env.example` | Listed `MY_KEY` in `env_required` but forgot `.env.example` | Add the missing key to `.env.example` |
| `open_source`: `400 Possible secret detected` | Secret scanner found a real-looking API key | Move to env var; `.env.example` value should be `your-key-here` |
| Marketplace shows service as free / missing after publish | Only `publish_preview()` was run — URL publish ≠ paid listing | Complete the chain: `create_paid_service` → `publish_service` |
| `create_paid_service`: `400 Free services should be published through the Project publish flow` | Tried `service_type: "free_project"` | Use `list_in_dashboard()` for free projects, not `create_paid_service()` |
| `publish_service`: `400 not in a publishable state` | Service is already listed, unavailable, or deleted | Check `get_service()` state; `unavailable` → `restore_service()` |
| `submit_for_review`: `400 Free services do not require review` | The service record was created as a FREE type — the paid payload was built by hand (missing `service_type`/wallet/pricing) instead of via `create_paid_service()` | Delete it and recreate with `create_paid_service()` (all paid fields are required positional args, so this cannot happen through the function) |
| Review rejected: `pricing_consistency` failed | 402 response `amount` doesn't match declared `price` | Ensure `amount` = `price * 1000000` (USDC 6 decimals) |
| Review rejected: `api_reachable` failed | Endpoint doesn't return 402 | Wire up x402 charging on the endpoint first |
| `create_paid_service` response has `project_slug_warning` | Passed `project_slug` for a `paid_api` but the slug doesn't exist in `project_listings` | Backend cleared it automatically. If this is a standalone API, don't pass `project_slug`. If you intended Flow D, `publish_preview()` + `list_in_dashboard()` the project first, then `update_service()` with the correct slug. |
| `create_paid_service`: `500 Failed to create service` after delete→create cycles with the SAME name | Deleted services keep their slug (soft delete), and slug generation only tries a limited number of suffixes — repeated delete/recreate with one name exhausts them | Do NOT wait and retry — the failure is permanent for that name. Use a different service name, or `restore_service(service_id)` + `update_service()` instead of delete+recreate |
| Created multiple services when user asked for "multiple APIs" | Called `create_paid_service()` once per API instead of using `api_endpoints` | Use Flow E: one `create_paid_service()` call with `api_endpoints=[...]` array. Only split into multiple services if the APIs are truly unrelated. |
| Purchases not recorded for external API (own facilitator) | Service was created without `source="manual"`, so no proxy URL is generated and Starchild has no way to observe payments | Either switch to the Starchild facilitator (Option A) or recreate the service with `source="manual"` (Option B) |
| Proxy URL returns 502 for `source="manual"` service | The `api_endpoint` URL is unreachable from Starchild servers | Verify the external API is publicly accessible and not behind a firewall |
| Marketplace shows a chain the 402 `accepts` doesn't have (or vice versa) | The service `networks_mode` and the x402 gateway's `accepts` got out of sync — e.g. listing is `all` (Base+Monad) but the x402 gateway was monetized with `--networks eip155:8453` (custom, Base only) | Re-run the x402 skill's `monetize` without `--networks` (to follow `all`), OR `update_service(service_id, networks_mode="custom", supported_networks=[...])` to match the gateway. The two must agree. |
| `create_paid_service` / `update_service` rejects with "supported_networks must be a non-empty list" | `networks_mode="custom"` was passed but `supported_networks` was missing, empty, or `None` | Pass a non-empty list of CAIP-2 ids (e.g. `["eip155:8453"]`), or switch to `networks_mode="all"` (the default) to accept all platform mainnets. |
| Buyer can't pay on Monad (402 has no Monad `accepts`) but listing shows Monad | The x402 gateway was monetized before the multi-chain release, or with `--networks eip155:8453` | Re-run `monetize` without `--networks` so the 402 `accepts` array includes every platform mainnet. The listing `all` mode is correct; the gateway side is stale. |
| Settlement fails on one chain but works on another | The Starchild facilitator's settler is out of gas on that chain (ETH for Base, MON for Monad) | Platform-side issue (gas is subsidized). The other chain keeps working. Report to ops — do NOT ask the provider to fund gas. |

## Cover Image Upload Flow

**⚠️ MANDATORY — read this section whenever you need to set or change a cover image.**

The gateway validates `cover_url` domains. Only `storage.googleapis.com`, `image.thum.io`,
and `api.microlink.io` are accepted. **Do NOT use imgur, data URIs, or any other hosting.**

### Quick path: `upload_cover_image()`

```python
from skills.community_publish.exports import upload_cover_image

result = upload_cover_image("my-slug", "/path/to/image.png")
# result = {"ok": True, "public_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/..."}

# Then use the URL:
list_in_dashboard("my-slug", name="My Project", cover_url=result["public_url"])
# or:
create_paid_service(..., cover_url=result["public_url"])
# or:
update_service(service_id, cover_url=result["public_url"])
```

### What `upload_cover_image()` does internally

1. **Presign** — calls `POST /api/projects/cover/presign` (container JWT via `Authorization: Bearer $CONTAINER_JWT`) with `slug`, `content_type`, `file_size`
2. **Upload** — PUTs the raw image bytes to the GCS V4 signed URL
3. **Returns** — the `public_url` on `storage.googleapis.com`

### Supported formats

- `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`
- Max 2MB — compress before uploading if needed

### If the user provides a large image

```python
# Compress first (PIL example)
from PIL import Image
import io

img = Image.open("/path/to/large.png")
img.thumbnail((1200, 630))  # reasonable cover dimensions
buf = io.BytesIO()
img.save(buf, format="JPEG", quality=85)
buf.seek(0)

# Save compressed version
compressed_path = "/tmp/cover_compressed.jpg"
with open(compressed_path, "wb") as f:
    f.write(buf.getvalue())

# Upload
result = upload_cover_image("my-slug", compressed_path)
```

### Common mistakes

| Mistake | Why it fails | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Using imgur URL as `cover_url` | Domain not in allowlist (project/internal routes reject with 400) | Use `upload_cover_image()` → GCS URL |
| Passing data URI as `cover_url` | Gateway returns 500 (URL too long / not a valid URL) | Save to file, then `upload_cover_image()` |
| Using thum.io to screenshot a preview page | Preview pages on internal ports are not publicly accessible | Use `upload_cover_image()` with the actual image file |
| Not reading the knowledge doc | Missing context on GCS config, path conventions, domain rules | Always check `starchild-knowledge/starchild-community-gateway/service-cover-upload.md` |

## Frontend presentation — Projects vs Services

The web frontend has **two separate modals** for community content:

| Modal | Content type | What it shows | Query functions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ProjectMarketplaceModal** | Free projects | Card grid: cover image, name, description, tags, views, favorites | `explore_projects()`, `my_projects()`, `favorite_projects()`, `get_tab_counts()`, `get_popular_tags()`, `get_user_projects()`, `favorite_project()`, `unfavorite_project()` |
| **MarketplaceModal** | Paid services (x402) | Service cards: pricing, ratings, purchase buttons | `explore_services()`, `list_my_services()`, `get_service_detail()`, `get_service_tags()`, `get_featured_services()` |

Both also appear in **AgentProfile** (Projects tab / Services tab) and the landing page.

Each project has a **direct URL** (path-based `/{slug}` or subdomain `{slug}.community.iamstarchild.com`). The `/projects` and `/services` pages are frontend-rendered browse pages.
