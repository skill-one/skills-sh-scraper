"""3D-style image generation script — 3D rendered 2D images for all 3D scenarios.

Generates 3D-style 2D images (NOT .glb/.obj 3D model files).
Covers: 3D characters, product renders, dioramas/isometric, icons, text,
interior design, architecture, scenes, and game assets.

Supports three models:
  - nano2    (fal-ai/gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview or /edit)   — fastest ~15s, good for drafts
  - nanopro  (fal-ai/gemini-3-pro-image-preview or /edit) — balanced ~25s, good quality (default)
  - gpt      (openai/gpt-image-2 or /edit)     — best quality, slow ~150s

Modes:
  - Text-to-image (primary): generates 3D-style images from text descriptions
  - Image-to-3D-style (edit): transforms a reference image into 3D-style rendering

Flow: resolve image → build prompt → submit to fal queue → poll → download.

Cost tracking: uses _cost_track.py to record per-call costs via sc-proxy
headers so the agent's per-turn cost_summary picks up this skill's cost.

Local testing: set FAL_KEY env var to call fal.ai directly (no sc-proxy).

    This is the primary function for all 3D image generation operations.
    Produces 3D-rendered 2D images (NOT .glb/.obj 3D model files).

    Supports both text-to-image (primary) and edit mode (reference → 3D style).

    Args:
        prompt: Text description of the desired 3D image.
            When provided with a category/style, enhances the style template.
            When provided alone, used as the primary instruction with 3D enhancement.
        reference_path: Local workspace file path to a reference image (optional).
            Used for image-to-3D-style transformation.
        reference_url: Public HTTPS URL of a reference image (optional).
            Used for image-to-3D-style transformation.
        category: 3D category preset — one of:
            character, product, diorama, icon, text, interior,
            architecture, scene, game_asset.
        style: Sub-style within the category (see CATEGORY_STYLES).
            If None, uses the "default" style for the category.
        model: Model key — "nanopro" (default, fast ~25s) or
            "gpt" (best quality ~150s).
        count: Number of images to generate (1-4).
            Uses fal.ai native num_images for efficient batch generation.
        aspect_ratio: Output ratio — "1:1", "3:4", "4:3", "9:16", "16:9".
            If None, auto-selected based on category.
        output_format: Output image format — "png" (default), "jpeg", or "webp".

    Returns:
        dict with keys:
            success (bool): Whether generation succeeded.
            images (list[dict]): List of generated images, each with:
                local_path (str): Path to downloaded file.
                url (str): Original fal CDN URL.
                size_bytes (int): File size.
            model (str): Model used.
            category (str): Category applied.
            style (str): Style applied.
            mode (str): "edit" or "generate".
            cost (float): Total credits used.
            error (str|None): Error message if failed.
