"""Catch fabricated "published / posted / updated" claims for AgentX & previews.

The problem: an agent sometimes writes "Published! community.iamstarchild.com/..."
or "Posted to AgentX: /post/123" or "I've updated the preview" when it did NOT
actually run the publishing tool — a hallucinated success. This hook checks the
reply against ground truth and either forces a redo or rewrites the reply so the
user never sees a false success.

Wire under one or more events in workspace/config/shell_hooks.yaml. Prefer
on_stop — it makes the agent ACTUALLY redo in ordinary chat:

  hooks:
    # (A) PREFERRED, every chat turn. Can BLOCK -> the host steers the reason
    #     back and the agent keeps working, so it actually publishes/redoes
    #     instead of just printing a corrected note. Loop-capped (MAX_BLOCKS).
    - event: on_stop
      matcher: "publish|posted|preview|/post/|community\\.iamstarchild|已发布|已上线|已更新|发布成功"
      command: ./extensions/shell_hooks/examples/verify_publish_claims.py
      timeout: 10

    # (B) Goal/supervisor mode only. Can BLOCK -> forces the agent to actually
    #     publish, then re-confirm. Loop-capped so it can never trap the agent.
    - event: on_completion_claim
      matcher: "publish|posted|preview|/post/|community\\.iamstarchild|已发布|已上线|已更新|发布成功"
      command: ./extensions/shell_hooks/examples/verify_publish_claims.py
      timeout: 10

    # (C) Fallback if on_stop isn't available. REWRITE-only: appends an honest
    #     correction to the stored reply; it cannot make the agent redo.
    - event: on_response_end
      matcher: "publish|posted|preview|/post/|community\\.iamstarchild|已发布|已上线|已更新|发布成功"
      command: ./extensions/shell_hooks/examples/verify_publish_claims.py
      timeout: 10

Design priorities, in order:
  1. NEVER trap the agent. A hard per-session block cap (MAX_BLOCKS) means even a
     wrong guess lets the turn through after a couple of nudges.
  2. Minimise false positives. We engage only on a *past-tense success* claim
     that *cites a concrete link*, and verify previews against the real registry
     (not this round's tool list — which is per-round and would misfire when the
     publish happened in an earlier round).
  3. Be honest about limits. AgentX posts have no local registry, so that branch
     is a softer heuristic; the block cap keeps it safe.
