# agent-observatory

**Standing goal:** keep a live, auditable index of every local agent session
(across Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Pi) and a dual Markdown + HTML
dashboard that only re-writes when some session state actually changed.

**One-line scenario:** many cheap watchers, one expensive synthesis. Your laptop
is already a sprawling multi-runtime agent state machine; this observatory turns
that mess into maintained world-models (sessions, summaries, workstreams,
concepts, an extracted `.prose` program, Markdown, and HTML), and proves that
the expensive synthesis only wakes on a real surprise.

This is the **multi-agent observatory** flagship: independent per-runtime facet
tokens (the dark lane), quiet watchers, a diamond fan-in woken exactly once, a
batched expensive synthesis gated on surprise, the folded-in **Session to Prose**
meta-generator as a standing node, and dual MD + HTML artifacts.

## The DAG (14 nodes / 22 edges)

`src/` ships the 9 authored contracts; the 14-node / 22-edge topology is what a
harness's expansion produces from them.

- **The dark lane:** the gateway exposes one INDEPENDENT facet token per runtime.
  A single Claude session edit moves only the `claude` token, so only the Claude
  Adapter lane lights; the three sibling adapters stay dark. The Session Ledger
  repeats the trick per session.
- **The diamond:** the three per-session summaries fan into the Workstream Index;
  a two-session delta wakes the index exactly once.
- **The batch gate:** the Concept Clusterer subscribes only to the
  `cluster-gate` facet (the distinct-workstream set), so it stays dark on small
  deltas and spends the single tall fresh spike only on a "major new project".
- **The fold-in:** Session to Prose watches one Claude transcript and maintains a
  generalized `.prose` contract, feeding the Markdown index.
- **Dual artifacts:** Agent Index (Markdown) + Agent Dashboard (HTML) re-render
  together only when DashboardData moved.

## Conformance expectations

A conforming harness proves deterministic replay, quiet memo-skips, one-runtime
lane isolation, one wake at the diamond fan-in, and a single expensive concept-
clusterer spike only when its gate moves.

## Replay any run you produce

A run leaves a real, chain-verifiable state on disk: the compiled topology, the
flat receipt ledger, and per-node world-models. Any conforming harness can
replay it with no model key to walk the cold cascade, the quiet flat line, the
one-runtime delta, the diamond single-wake, and the single tall
Concept-Clusterer spike.
