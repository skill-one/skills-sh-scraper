# inbox-triage

**Architecture: diamond fan-in + failure isolation.** Domain: email / personal-ops.

> The same newsletter hits FIVE inboxes, summarized ONCE. One malformed email
> fails, your digest still ships.

The standing goal: keep a noisy multi-inbox mail feed triaged into one shipped
daily digest, paying only for what actually changed, and never letting one bad
email take the digest down.

## What it teaches

- **Diamond dedup = a single wake.** Five recipients receive the _same_
  newsletter. Each delivery lights its own classifier lane and re-runs the
  threader, but the threader's `thread:newsletter` facet fingerprints ONLY the
  canonical content, so it moves exactly once. The shared per-thread render fires
  ONCE; copies 2..5 dedup-skip. Many wakes fan IN, one wake comes OUT.
- **Failure isolation.** One email is malformed; its classifier render throws. The
  reconciler records a `failed` receipt that **carries zero fresh and wakes
  nothing downstream**. The threader re-groups over the healthy classifications,
  the digest still ships, and a later fixed re-delivery recovers (a fresh
  `rendered` receipt); failure stays contained in one node.
- **The dark lane.** A delivery to one inbox moves ONLY that email's
  `email:<id>` facet; every sibling classifier stays dark.

16 nodes / 27 edges. `gateway.inbox-stream` is the single entry point; the graph
is acyclic. `src/` ships the 4 authored contracts; the 16-node / 27-edge topology
is what a harness's expansion produces from them.

## Conformance expectations

A conforming harness proves dark sibling lanes, one render for duplicate
newsletter content, contained classifier failure with zero fresh propagation, a
digest built from healthy inputs, recovery, chain verification, and deterministic
replay.

A run leaves a keyless, chain-verifiable state on disk that any conforming
harness can replay (the universal "aha"):

```text
dispositions rendered=… · skipped=… · failed=1
the shared newsletter thread renders ONCE; copies 2..5 skip; one failed email; digest still ships
```

## What ships here

- `src/*.prose.md`: the gateway + classifier + threader + digest contracts.

A run writes a keyless, chain-verifiable state (topology, labels, beats,
receipts, world-models) that a conforming harness replays unchanged.
