# github-star-enricher

> **Standing goal:** turn open-source attention into thoughtful, evidence-backed
> outreach without becoming spammy. New GitHub stars fan out into per-stargazer
> intelligence; company enrichment is memoized and **shared** across stargazers;
> expensive external calls are **cost-gated**; and the terminal artifact is a
> human-reviewed outreach packet that **never auto-sends**.

**One-line scenario:** three new stars land in one batch: `alice` (high-fit,
`acme`), `bob` (mid-fit, `acme`), `casey` (low-fit, solo). The loop fans them out,
enriches `acme` **once** for both `alice` and `bob`, gates `casey`'s expensive Exa
call **off**, builds and runs a tiny OpenProse sample program for `alice`, and
leaves her outreach packet at `ready_for_review` (drafted, not sent).

This is an OpenProse growth dogfood loop. It stakes out an architecture:
**per-entity fan-out + shared-company receipts + cost-gated enrichment + a hard
human gate**, with an execution-backed sample program as the artifact.

## The DAG (per-person fan-out, a shared-company diamond, a human gate)

```

`Footprint[alice]` subscribes to **only** the registry's `eligible:alice` facet,
so a new star on one stargazer never wakes another's lane (per-person fan-out).
`Company[acme]` fans **in** from both `alice`'s and `bob`'s footprints and renders
**once**: when `bob` later wakes it the truth has not moved, so it memo-**skips**
and reuses the shared receipt. `Person[casey]` reads `clears_enrichment_threshold`
and, finding it false, returns a cheap deferred truth without ever paying for Exa.
And `Outreach Packet[*]` carries `auto_send: false` and can only reach
`sent_by_human` through a real action at the **Human Review Events** gateway.

## Conformance expectations

A conforming harness proves per-person lane isolation, one shared `acme`
enrichment, cost-gated `casey` enrichment, debuggable failure and recovery, quiet
zero-fresh replay, and the `auto_send:false` human gate.

A run leaves a chain-verifiable state on disk that any conforming harness can
replay keyless (the marquee frame):

```text
dispositions rendered=… · skipped=… · failed=1   (a scripted Exa outage)
chain-verify ok
```

## What to try

- **Cost scales with surprise.** Re-run with the _same_ star batch and no new
  review action: the `star-events` gateway memo-**skips**, propagates nothing, and
  the whole graph stays dark (`fresh 0`). Polling frequency does not drive spend;
  surprise does.
- **Move one stargazer.** New GitHub evidence on `alice` perturbs only
  `user:alice` → only `eligible:alice` → only her footprint lane re-renders, and
  because her footprint truth is unchanged the move is **absorbed at the footprint
  boundary** (nothing deeper re-runs). `bob`'s and `casey`'s lanes stay **dark**
  (sibling isolation).
- **Watch the shared company.** `Company[acme]` renders once for `alice` and is
  _reused_ (a memo-skip) when `bob`'s lane wakes it: enrichment is paid per
  company, not per stargazer. Even `bob`'s person-lane retry (below) never re-runs
  it: the company subscribes to a narrow `company-signal` facet, not the retry.
- **Survive a failed external call.** The Exa People adapter goes down for `bob`:
  `Person[bob]` fails **loud and debuggable**; the failed receipt's cost names the
  broken call (`provider: "exa"`, `model: "exa-people"`), the prior identity
  stands, and nothing downstream wakes. When Exa is back, his lane **recovers** on
  the next wake. A failure propagates nothing, exactly like a skip.
- **Trip the cost gate.** Raise `casey`'s GitHub signal above the threshold and her
  `Person[casey]` render jumps from a cheap deferred truth to a ~6× Exa spend.
- **The human gate holds.** No matter the fit, every packet carries
  `auto_send: false` and stops at `ready_for_review`; only a `send_mark` at the
  **Human Review Events** gateway advances it to `sent_by_human`.
