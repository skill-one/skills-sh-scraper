# press-desk

**Architecture: a deterministic human gate + a privacy projection.** Domain:
press / partnerships. Inbox: `press@agents.openprose.ai`.

> Inbound press inquiries become a live opportunity register — a high-stakes
> inquiry STOPS at a human gate (never auto-replies), and the public-facing view
> never leaks sender PII.

The standing goal: keep the inbound press / partnership / speaking inbox triaged
into a live opportunity register, paying only for what actually changed, while
two hard safety lines hold by construction — the system never takes an outward
action a human must own, and no sender PII ever escapes into a public projection.

## What it teaches

- **The human gate (`gateCommit`).** A HIGH-importance inquiry drives the briefing
  to status `needs_human` with `auto_reply: false`. The render still *maintains*
  the truth (the register update lands), but it *refuses* the outward action — the
  reply is reserved for a human. The system drafts and packages; it never replies
  by itself. A brief that has reached `needs_human` **skips** on the next quiet
  re-poll — it does not drift and it does not send itself.
- **The privacy projection.** The briefing holds the FULL owner-only view (sender
  name + email + ask) behind `@atomic`, and exposes a `public` facet that is a
  PROJECTION carrying kind + ask + status ONLY. The sender PII never enters the
  public slice, so a downstream public consumer that subscribes to the `public`
  facet can never see who wrote in — privacy by construction, not by review.
- **The dark lane.** A PR blast / cold marketing email is judged irrelevant, so
  its relevance filter leaves its `qualified` facet NULL — a fixed, byte-identical
  token that never moves. The opportunity register never wakes on the noise.

```

8 nodes / 14 edges. `gateway.press-inbox` is the single entry point; the graph is
acyclic. (The `speaking` register facet is a *zero-consumer-until-it-moves* lane:
no speaking inquiry is delivered in the scripted episode, so it never wakes — the
same discipline that keeps the dark lanes still.) `src/` ships the 4 authored
contracts; the 8-node / 14-edge topology is what a harness's expansion produces
from them.

## Conformance expectations

A conforming harness proves junk leaves the graph dark, high-stakes inquiries
stop at `needs_human` with `auto_reply:false`, quiet re-polls skip, and the
`public` projection never contains sender PII.

A run leaves a keyless, chain-verifiable state on disk that any conforming
harness can replay — the universal "aha":

```text
the PR blast stays dark; a HIGH inquiry stops at needs_human (auto_reply:false);
the public view carries kind + ask, never the sender
```

## What ships here

- `src/*.prose.md` — the press-inbox gateway + relevance-filter + opportunity-
  register + briefing contracts (the durable intent the fake renders mirror).
