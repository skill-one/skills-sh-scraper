# Storage Backends

## Use this when

- Loading data from a file referenced in a datapackage.json descriptor.
- Choosing the right tool for a given file format.
- Writing reproducible data-loading code for a user.

**Only proceed here if the user has explicitly asked to query or load data.** Metadata
exploration (descriptor querying) does not require touching data files at all.

---

## How datapackage.json describes data files

Each resource has:

- `path`: relative path **or URL** to the data file. If relative, resolve it against
    the base directory or base URL of the descriptor (see `metadata-querying.md`).
- `format`: file format string (e.g. `"parquet"`, `"csv"`, `"sqlite"`, `"duckdb"`)
- `mediatype`: MIME type (e.g. `"application/parquet"`, `"text/csv"`)

```bash
# Get all resource names, paths, and formats
jq -r '.resources[] | "\(.name)\t\(.path)\t\(.format // "unknown")"' datapackage.json
```

**Format preference**: when a dataset offers the same data in multiple formats, prefer
Parquet or DuckDB over SQLite or CSV — they are faster, typed, and support remote
access without downloading. SQLite files **must be local** (see below).

---

## DuckDB (preferred)

DuckDB is the preferred tool for data querying. It is a standalone CLI tool — no Python
environment required. If DuckDB is not installed, use `/install-duckdb` to
install it before proceeding. It handles Parquet, CSV, and DuckDB files with a unified
SQL interface, reads remote files over HTTPS or S3 without downloading them, and can
combine descriptor metadata queries with data queries in a single session.

Use `/query` to run SQL or natural language queries through it, and
`/attach-db` to register database files.

You are not limited to `read_parquet` — DuckDB can query any supported format
directly:

```sql
-- Parquet (local or remote)
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('/path/to/my_table.parquet') LIMIT 100;
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('https://example.com/data/my_table.parquet') LIMIT 100;
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('s3://my-bucket/my_table.parquet') LIMIT 100;

-- JSON
SELECT * FROM read_json('/path/to/data.json', format='auto') LIMIT 100;

-- Multiple files as one table (glob)
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('/data/part-*.parquet') LIMIT 100;

-- Attached DuckDB or SQLite database (via attach-db)
SELECT * FROM my_db.my_table LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM read_csv('/path/to/my_table.csv') LIMIT 100;
SELECT * FROM read_csv('https://example.com/data/my_table.csv') LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
ATTACH '/path/to/my_database.duckdb' AS db (READ_ONLY);
SELECT * FROM db.my_table LIMIT 100;
```

### Finding the correct table name in a database file

The Frictionless spec has no standard field for specifying which table inside a
`.duckdb` or `.sqlite` file a resource refers to — the `path` field only points to the
database file itself. Table names are indicated by non-standard extension fields, and
practice varies by publisher. Work through these in order:

**1. Check the resource for a table-name extension field.** Common field names:

```bash
jq '.resources[] | select(.name == "my_resource") | {table, duckdb_table, sqlite_table}' datapackage.json
```

If any of those is non-null, that is the table name to use.

**2. Try the resource `name` or `title`.** Publishers often name the table to match
the resource identifier. Try both as-is and with hyphens replaced by underscores
(SQL identifiers cannot contain hyphens).

**3. List all tables in the database** and match by inspection:

```sql
-- After attaching the file as `db`:

-- DuckDB file: SHOW TABLES only lists the in-memory database; use SHOW ALL TABLES
-- and filter to the attached database name.
SELECT name FROM (SHOW ALL TABLES) WHERE database = 'db' ORDER BY name;

-- SQLite file
SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type = 'table' ORDER BY name;
```

Compare the table names against the resource `name`, `title`, and `description` to
find the right one.

### Exploring unfamiliar tables

Always start with a small `LIMIT` — **10 to 100 rows** is enough to understand
structure, spot nulls, and get a feel for the data. Only increase the limit once you
know what you're working with. The `/query` skill warns before executing
queries that would return more than 1M rows, but that is a safety ceiling, not a
target. To interrupt a running query, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

### Combining descriptor metadata with data queries

```sql
-- Find tables with a specific column, then sample one
WITH tables_with_col AS (
    SELECT r->>'$.name' AS table_name, r->>'$.path' AS path
    FROM (SELECT unnest(resources) AS r FROM read_json('datapackage.json', format='auto'))
    WHERE list_contains(
        [f->>'$.name' FOR f IN r->'$.schema.fields'],
        'plant_id_eia'
    )
)
SELECT * FROM read_parquet(base_url || '/' || path)
FROM tables_with_col
LIMIT 10;
```

### Getting a pandas DataFrame from DuckDB

```python
import duckdb

df = duckdb.sql("SELECT * FROM read_parquet('my_table.parquet') LIMIT 100").df()
```

## Joining tables safely

`schema.primaryKey` and `schema.foreignKeys` are standard Frictionless fields that
describe how a resource's rows are uniquely identified and how they relate to other
resources. When a user's question needs data from more than one table, read these
fields rather than guessing a join column from name similarity — a shared or
plausible-looking column name is not a guarantee that the values line up, and a real
`foreignKeys` entry can name a composite key or a differently-named reference field that
naming alone would never reveal.

```bash
# Does this resource declare a primary key, and what other resource does it reference?
jq '.resources[] | select(.name == "daily-readings") | {primaryKey: .schema.primaryKey, foreignKeys: .schema.foreignKeys}' datapackage.json
```

```json
{
  "primaryKey": ["station_id", "date"],
  "foreignKeys": [
    {
      "fields": ["station_id"],
      "reference": { "resource": "stations", "fields": ["station_id"] }
    }
  ]
}
```

Each `foreignKeys` entry names the local `fields` and the `reference.resource` /
`reference.fields` they point to. Both `fields` arrays are equal-length lists — for a
composite key, join on every corresponding pair, not just the first.

Use those field names directly in the join, whether the resources are plain files or
tables in an attached database:

```sql
-- Column names come from the foreignKeys lookup above, not from guessing
SELECT r.station_id, r.date, r.temp_max_c, s.station_name, s.elevation_m
FROM read_csv('daily-readings.csv') AS r
JOIN read_csv('stations.csv') AS s
  ON r.station_id = s.station_id
LIMIT 10;
```

Not every descriptor declares `foreignKeys` even where a real relationship exists — the
field is optional, and plenty of publishers omit it. Its absence isn't proof that two
tables *can't* be joined, only that the descriptor doesn't tell you how; in that case,
confirm the join column by reading both resources' field descriptions before writing
the query, rather than assuming a name match is safe.

## Polars (preferred for large Python workflows)

Polars is preferred over pandas for large datasets — it is faster, more
memory-efficient, and supports lazy evaluation. If the user ultimately needs a pandas
DataFrame, convert at the end:

```python
import polars as pl

# Parquet — lazy (pushes filters and column selection into the reader)
lf = pl.scan_parquet("/path/to/data/my_table.parquet")
df_polars = (
    lf.select(["id", "date", "value"]).filter(pl.col("date") >= "2020-01-01").collect()
)

# Convert to pandas only if needed downstream
df_pandas = df_polars.to_pandas()
```

```python
# CSV — lazy
lf = pl.scan_csv("/path/to/data/my_table.csv")
df_polars = lf.select(["id", "date", "value"]).collect()
df_pandas = df_polars.to_pandas()  # only if needed
```

---

## pandas

Use pandas when the user specifically needs a pandas-idiomatic workflow.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Parquet (local or remote — requires s3fs for S3, fsspec for HTTPS)
df = pd.read_parquet("/path/to/data/my_table.parquet")
df = pd.read_parquet("s3://my-bucket/path/my_table.parquet")

# Column projection (much faster for wide tables)
df = pd.read_parquet("/path/to/data/my_table.parquet", columns=["id", "date", "value"])
```

## CSV

```python
df = pd.read_csv("/path/to/data/my_table.csv")
```

---

## SQLite

**SQLite files must be local.** DuckDB and the Python `sqlite3` module cannot read
SQLite over HTTP or S3 — download the file first if it is remote. Prefer Parquet or
DuckDB formats if the dataset offers them.

```bash
# Download first if remote
curl -O https://example.com/data/my_database.sqlite
```

Via DuckDB (preferred — use `/attach-db`):

```sql
-- attach-db handles this; shown here for reference
ATTACH '/path/to/my_database.sqlite' AS db (TYPE sqlite, READ_ONLY);
SELECT * FROM db.my_table LIMIT 100;
```

To find the correct table name, follow the same process as for DuckDB files — see
**Finding the correct table name in a database file** above.

Via Python stdlib (when DuckDB is unavailable):

```python
import sqlite3, pandas as pd

con = sqlite3.connect("/path/to/data/my_database.sqlite")
df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM my_table LIMIT 100", con)
con.close()
```

## Quick reference

- **Any format, SQL or natural language** — `/query`
- **Attach a .duckdb or .sqlite file for session queries** — `/attach-db`
- **Remote Parquet/CSV (HTTPS/S3), no download** — `/query`
- **Metadata + data in one session** — `/query` with `read_json` + data query
- **Large dataset in Python** — polars (convert to pandas at the end if needed)
- **SQLite** — download first, then DuckDB `ATTACH` or `sqlite3`
- **Typed, reproducible loading** — Parquet > DuckDB > CSV > SQLite
