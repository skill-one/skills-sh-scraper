# Metadata Querying

## Use this when

- Discovering which resources (tables) a dataset contains.
- Looking up what a resource or field means before loading data.
- Reading descriptions to understand data provenance, processing notes, and caveats.
- Searching for a column by name or topic across all resources.

In this skill, metadata discovery always uses **jq** — it's installed everywhere,
reads only what you ask for, and needs no session or setup. Reserve DuckDB for the
data files a descriptor points to (Parquet, SQLite, DuckDB, CSV); it isn't needed to
read the descriptor's own JSON.

## Spec reference

The Frictionless Data Package v2.0 specification and its JSON Schema are at
<https://datapackage.org/>. The JSON Schema itself (useful for validation) is at:
<https://datapackage.org/profiles/2.0/datapackage.json>

The spec is intentionally permissive: it defines a set of standard fields but allows
implementors to add non-standard keys anywhere — at the package, resource, or field
level. When you encounter unrecognized keys (like `unit`, `warning`, `bytes`, `hash`,
or source-specific metadata), treat them as informative extensions, not errors.

**Non-tabular resources**: not all resources have a `schema`. A resource may describe
an opaque file (PDF, ZIP, CSV without column metadata) and omit `schema.fields`
entirely. When `schema` is absent, the resource is still valid — just treat it as a
file reference rather than a queryable table.

**Integrity fields**: real-world descriptors often include `bytes` (file size in bytes)
and `hash` (checksum) on each resource. The `hash` value is usually in
`algorithm:hex` format (e.g. `"md5:abc123..."` or `"sha256:def456..."`); if no prefix
is present, assume MD5. For small files, use these to verify a download. For large
files (hundreds of MB or more), hashing is slow — check `bytes` first as a quick
sanity check, and only verify the hash if you suspect corruption.

```bash
# Find which resources have hashes
jq '.resources[] | select(.hash != null) | {name, bytes, hash}' "$PKG"

# Check hash of a downloaded file (macOS — strip any "md5:" prefix before comparing)
md5 stations.csv

# Check hash (Linux)
md5sum stations.csv
```

## Golden rule: never load the full datapackage.json into context

A `datapackage.json` can be megabytes with hundreds of resources and thousands of
fields. Always query it selectively — extract only the slice you need.

Use jq for descriptor metadata queries. Use DuckDB for querying the data files
referenced by resource `path`.

---

## Workflow

1. **Locate the descriptor** — find or download `datapackage.json` and note its base
    URL if remote (needed to resolve relative resource paths).
1. **Identify candidate resources** — search by name or description keyword.
1. **Read the resource description** — it contains source notes, primary key
    conventions, caveats, and processing history. Read it fully before presenting.
1. **Read column descriptions** for the specific columns the user needs.
1. **Confirm the data file path** — the `path` field is either a relative path
    (resolve against the descriptor's base directory or base URL) or an absolute URL.
1. **Load the data** *(only if the user asks)* — see
    [`storage-backends.md`](storage-backends.md).

---

## Step 1: Locate the descriptor

Check in this order:

1. **User-provided path** — the user may have a local file or know the URL.
1. **Alongside the data files** — `datapackage.json` is conventionally placed in the
    same directory as the data files it describes.
1. **Published URL** — dataset publishers often host the descriptor at a stable HTTPS
    URL. Check the dataset's README or documentation.

**Multiple descriptor files**: the spec requires the filename `datapackage.json`, but
in practice a directory may contain several descriptors (e.g.
`pudl_parquet_datapackage.json`, `ferc1_xbrl_datapackage.json`) associated with
different datasets. Treat each as a separate package.

**Remote descriptors and path resolution**: if you download a remote `datapackage.json`,
store its original base URL. Resource `path` values may be relative (e.g.
`my_table.parquet`) and must be resolved against that base URL, not the local download
directory. For example, if the descriptor was at
`https://example.com/data/datapackage.json` and a resource has `path: my_table.parquet`, the full data URL is `https://example.com/data/my_table.parquet`.

```bash
# Download and record the base URL
BASE_URL="https://example.com/data"
curl -O "$BASE_URL/datapackage.json"
PKG=datapackage.json

# Resolve a resource path to its full URL
jq -r '.resources[] | select(.name == "my_table") | .path' "$PKG"
# → "my_table.parquet"  (prepend $BASE_URL/ to get the full URL)
```

**Version checking**: before using a descriptor, verify it matches the data you have.
If the descriptor contains hash or byte-size information for resources, check them:

```bash
# Look for hash or bytes fields on resources (non-standard but common)
jq '.resources[] | {name, hash, bytes}' "$PKG"
```

Store the local path in `PKG` for reuse in queries below.

---

## Steps 2–5: jq

jq is the default for selective querying of a local JSON file. It reads only what you
ask for and requires no additional setup. **jq cannot fetch over HTTPS** — if the
descriptor is remote, download it first with `curl -O <URL>`, then point jq at the
local file.

### Step 2: Identify candidate resources

```bash
# Count total number of resources
jq '.resources | length' "$PKG"

# List all resource names
jq -r '.resources[].name' "$PKG"

# List resource names and their file formats
jq -r '.resources[] | "\(.name)\t\(.format // "unknown")"' "$PKG"

# Find resources whose name contains a keyword
jq -r '.resources[] | select(.name | test("generation"; "i")) | .name' "$PKG"

# Find resources whose description contains a keyword
jq '.resources[] | select(.description | test("capacity factor"; "i")) | {name, description: .description[:300]}' "$PKG"
```

### Step 3: Read resource and field descriptions

The spec is permissive — resources often carry extra non-spec fields beyond `name`,
`path`, `description`, and `schema`. Explore openly:

```bash
# Full description for one resource (includes processing notes, primary key, caveats)
jq -r '.resources[] | select(.name == "my_table") | .description' "$PKG"

# See all keys present on a resource (not just spec-defined ones)
jq '.resources[] | select(.name == "my_table") | keys' "$PKG"

# See all non-schema fields on a resource
jq '.resources[] | select(.name == "my_table") | del(.schema)' "$PKG"
```

Fields are also permissive — in addition to `name`, `description`, and `type`, a
field may carry extra metadata such as `unit`, `constraints`, `warning`, or
dataset-specific annotations. Always explore the full field object:

```bash
# Column names for a resource
jq -r '.resources[] | select(.name == "my_table") | .schema.fields[].name' "$PKG"

# All metadata for every field (not just name and description)
jq '.resources[] | select(.name == "my_table") | .schema.fields[]' "$PKG"

# Column names, descriptions, and units (unit may be absent on some fields)
jq '.resources[] | select(.name == "my_table") | .schema.fields[] | {name, description, unit}' "$PKG"

# Find fields that have a unit defined
jq '.resources[] | select(.name == "my_table") | .schema.fields[] | select(.unit != null) | {name, unit}' "$PKG"

# Find fields that carry a non-standard warning annotation
jq '.resources[] | select(.name == "my_table") | .schema.fields[] | select(.warning != null) | {name, warning}' "$PKG"

# See all keys used across all fields in a resource (reveals non-spec extensions)
jq '[.resources[] | select(.name == "my_table") | .schema.fields[] | keys[]] | unique' "$PKG"

# Find all resources that contain a specific column name
jq '.resources[] | {table: .name, fields: [.schema.fields[] | select(.name == "plant_id_eia")]} | select(.fields | length > 0)' "$PKG"
```

### Joining resources: primary keys and foreign keys

**Before joining two resources, or aggregating one, check their declared keys —
don't infer a join column from matching names.** The Table Schema spec gives every
resource an explicit `schema.primaryKey` (the field or fields that uniquely identify
a row) and an optional `schema.foreignKeys` array (each entry a `fields` list plus a
`reference` naming the target resource and field it points to). When both ends of a
join are declared, you can walk the relationship directly instead of guessing:

```bash
# Check a resource's primary key and declared foreign keys together
jq '.resources[] | select(.name == "my_table") | {primaryKey: .schema.primaryKey, foreignKeys: .schema.foreignKeys}' "$PKG"

# Find every resource with at least one declared foreign key
jq '.resources[] | select(.schema.foreignKeys | length > 0) | .name' "$PKG"

# Find what a specific field's foreign key points to
jq '.resources[] | select(.name == "my_table") | .schema.foreignKeys[] | select(.fields == ["utility_id"])' "$PKG"
```

Two columns can share a name and still not be safe to join on — and, more subversively,
two columns that share a name can refer to *different entities*, not just different
formats of the same entity. A `name` field on two resources might be one resource's
row-identifying string and another's free-text label; only the declared `primaryKey`
tells you which. Never join on a human-readable name/label column (company name,
site name, description) when an ID column is available, even if the ID column's
values look opaque — string identity is a coincidence until proven otherwise, ID
identity is asserted by the schema.

**Not every join path is declared.** `foreignKeys` coverage is often incomplete in
real-world descriptors — a resource may have an obviously-joinable ID column (same
name, same apparent meaning as another resource's primary key) with no formal
`foreignKeys` entry linking them. Treat a missing declaration as "unverified," not
"no relationship exists": fall back to matching same-named ID columns across
resources, but confirm the join is sound before trusting its output — spot-check a
handful of joined rows, or verify a known identity (e.g. component values summing to
a reported total) rather than assuming a plausible-looking join is a correct one.

**Worked failure mode**: two resources each have a `facility_name` column that looks
joinable — same rough meaning, similar-looking values. Joining directly on
`facility_name` silently merges rows for facilities that share a name but are
different entities (a common company name reused across unrelated sites, or a
generic name like "Plant 1" reused across operators) — no error, no warning, just
rows matched to the wrong facility. Checking `schema.primaryKey` on the source
resource first would have shown the real identifying column (e.g. `facility_id`) to
join on instead.

Package-level metadata follows the same pattern:

```bash
# See all top-level fields (excluding the potentially huge resources array)
jq 'del(.resources)' "$PKG"

# Or just the keys present at the top level
jq 'keys' "$PKG"
```

### Steps 4–5: Confirm the path, then load

```bash
# Data file path for a resource (may be a relative path or a URL)
jq -r '.resources[] | select(.name == "my_table") | .path' "$PKG"

# List resource names and their paths
jq -r '.resources[] | "\(.name)\t\(.path)"' "$PKG"
```

If the path is relative, prepend `$BASE_URL/` (recorded in Step 1). Then load —
see [`storage-backends.md`](storage-backends.md).

## Step 5 handoff: default to DuckDB for data queries

DuckDB is a standalone CLI tool — no Python environment required.
The `/install-duckdb` skill should be used to install it if it is not already installed.
Use `/query` to run queries through it — that skill handles CLI invocation, session state, natural language, and large result warnings.
Once jq has identified the resource path, switch to DuckDB for the actual data query.

Keep these concerns separate:

- jq: descriptor metadata (`resources`, `schema`, descriptions, paths)
- DuckDB: table/file contents

```bash
# Step 4 in jq: get the resource path
REL_PATH=$(jq -r '.resources[] | select(.name == "my_table") | .path' "$PKG")

# Resolve local path (if relative) and query data with DuckDB
duckdb -c "SELECT * FROM read_parquet('$REL_PATH') LIMIT 10"
duckdb -c "SELECT * FROM read_csv('$REL_PATH') LIMIT 10"
```

For `.duckdb` and `.sqlite` resources, follow the attach-and-query patterns in
[`storage-backends.md`](storage-backends.md).
