"""Shared helpers for the live MCP e2e suites.

A ``_``-prefixed (non-``test_``) module so the per-suite modules
(``test_mcp.py``, ``test_mcp_http.py``, ``test_mcp_contracts.py``) can share the
in-memory FastMCP driver + the downloadable-artifact mapping WITHOUT importing
one ``test_*`` module from another (forbidden by
``tests/_guardrails/test_no_cross_test_imports.py``).

Imported only by modules that have already ``pytest.importorskip("fastmcp")``,
so the ``fastmcp`` import here is safe (it never loads on a no-``mcp`` install).
