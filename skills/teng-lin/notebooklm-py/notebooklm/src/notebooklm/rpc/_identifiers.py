class RPCMethod(str, Enum):
    """RPC method IDs for NotebookLM operations.

    These are obfuscated method identifiers used by the batchexecute API.
    Reverse-engineered from network traffic analysis.

    Many members carry a ``-> <Method>`` comment (trailing, or on the line
    above when it would overflow) naming the live
    ``/LabsTailwindOrchestrationService.<Method>`` endpoint the obfuscated id
    resolves to (recovered from Google's own id registry; entries on a
    *different* service spell out the service prefix). That backend name is the
    source of truth for what the RPC *actually does* — our enum member name is a
    reverse-engineered label that is sometimes narrower or older than the real
    method. Where the two diverge (e.g. ``LIST_NOTEBOOKS -> ListRecentlyViewedProjects``,
    ``GENERATE_MIND_MAP -> ActOnSources``), the comment is the authoritative semantics and
    the divergence is documented at the call site too. The member names
    themselves are part of the internal RPC contract and are intentionally left
    unchanged; only the clarifying comments were corrected.
