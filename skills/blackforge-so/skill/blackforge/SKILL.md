  Answer crypto market-data questions with BlackForge. Use this skill whenever the user asks about
  order-book or trade data for a coin on a spot venue — its latest stats on an exchange,
  order-book depth or resting/pulled liquidity for a pair, taker buy-vs-sell volume, order-ladder
  rungs, price-level lifetime, trade timing, outsized trades, or market-cap/attention enrichment;
  when they want to pull, chart or compare a metric over a time range; or when they ask which pairs
  a venue lists. Covers 9 spot exchanges (binance, bitget, bybit, coinbase, gate, kraken, kucoin,
  mexc, okx) and ~11,800 spot pairs — 120 measurement columns per pair per closed
  5-minute window. Trigger even when BlackForge is not named but the question is
  about crypto market data on a venue. Drives the BlackForge MCP tools (blackforge_catalog /
  blackforge_symbols / blackforge_latest / blackforge_series / blackforge_usage) or the `blackforge`
  CLI; never reimplements the API. Every returned column is a measurement, not a trade call.

# BlackForge market-data

BlackForge is a **raw market-data** product: for every `(exchange, symbol)` it stores one wide row
per closed **5-minute window**, **120 measurement columns** across ~11,800 spot pairs —
order-book depth, resting-liquidity dynamics, trade-flow and trade-timing measurements, plus
market-cap and attention enrichment, and a per-row quality bitmask. This skill lets you answer a
plain-language market-data question by calling BlackForge's own tools and reading the rows back
**as measurements**.

You are a thin orchestration + interpretation layer. **Never** build HTTP requests, curl the API,
or hardcode an endpoint URL. Always go through the MCP tools or the `blackforge` CLI. Your job is to
know the vocabulary (which metric answers which question), run the right call, and explain the
numbers correctly.

## What BlackForge is — and is not

It is a measurement feed. Each column has a precise definition (e.g. *"resting sell liquidity from
the best ask up to +100%"*, *"quote notional that left the bid side of the book"*, *"median
lifetime of a price level created and removed inside the window"*). Present results in exactly that
register: **a measurement with a definition and a unit**.

It describes what happened in the book and on the tape — it does not tell the user what will happen
next or what to trade. Do not describe any column, or the data as a whole, using the words **signal,
pump, anomaly, probability-scored, alpha, prediction, detection, or alert**, and do not imply
the data forecasts or recommends anything. Say what was *measured* ("bid depth within 5% fell from X
to Y"), not what it *means for a trade*. This framing is the whole point of the skill.

**Where the line falls.** If the question contains a real market-data question wearing trading
clothes — "is there a big sell wall on DOGE, should I be worried?" — hold the framing and answer
with the measurement. But a request for a **recommendation with no data question inside it**
("should I buy ETH right now?") is **not** a BlackForge question: do not trigger on it, and do not
reach for market data to dress up an answer. Say plainly that you do not give trade advice, and
offer to show what the book and the tape actually measured if that would help.

("Flag" is the one exception, and only in its literal sense: `qualityFlags` is a real column and a
flagged *bucket* is a statement about data quality, never about the market.)

Also: never propose narrowing the venue or coin universe to save cost — the full universe is the
product.

## The playbook: discover → pick → call → interpret

### 1. Discover first — never guess identifiers

Before any keyed query, call **`blackforge_catalog`** (CLI: `blackforge catalog`). It is keyless and
returns the 9 venues (each with its `minPlan`) and all 120 metrics with `key`, `label`, `unit`,
`family`, `description`, `howToRead` and `minPlan`. Use it to resolve:

- the exact **`exchange`** identifier (lowercase: `binance`, `okx`, …), and
- the exact **`metric`** key the user's words map to (e.g. "resting depth"/"sell wall"/"pulled
  liquidity" → the right `downDepth*` / `upDepth*` / `bidLiqRemoved` … key).

  **Some words have no key.** There is no spread column — the catalog has `bestBid` and `bestAsk`,
  and a spread is something YOU derive from two `blackforge_series` calls. When the catalog has no
  key for what was asked, say so and offer what it does measure. Never answer a spread question
  with a depth number: depth is resting size, not the distance between the two sides.

Never invent a metric key or a venue name. If you already hold a recent catalog in the conversation
you may reuse it, but when unsure, re-fetch — it is cheap and keyless. For a compact index of every
metric grouped by family with its one-line measurement definition, read
[`references/metrics-glossary.md`](references/metrics-glossary.md); the live catalog wording is
canonical when they differ.

To list the pairs a venue trades, call **`blackforge_symbols({exchange})`**
(CLI: `blackforge symbols --exchange <v>`). Symbol format is the venue's own
(`BTCUSDT` on binance, `BTC-USDT` on okx/coinbase) — confirm via symbols rather than assuming.

### 2. Pick the right tool for the shape of the question

| The user wants… | Call | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| a coin's **latest** stats on a venue (one snapshot) | `blackforge_latest({exchange, symbol, columns?})` | returns `{ ts, values }` for the last complete bucket **at the caller's plan granularity** — `5m` on max/ultra, **`1h` on pro, `1d` on free**. On the coarser tiers `ts` is the bucket start, so a free key's "latest" can be a day old. Nothing in the response says which granularity you got, so state the bucket length you are reading. Pass `columns` (metric keys) to keep the answer focused; omit for the full row. |
| how a metric **moved over a time range** | `blackforge_series({exchange, symbol, metric, from, to, interval})` | returns `{ points: [{ ts, value }] }`, `ts` in epoch ms. One metric per call. |
| **which pairs** a venue lists | `blackforge_symbols({exchange})` | |
| **usage / quota** left | `blackforge_usage()` | recent daily usage + rows remaining this month. |

CLI fallback maps 1:1: `blackforge latest …`, `blackforge series …`, `blackforge symbols …`,
`blackforge usage`. Prefer `--output json` when you will parse the result.

**Choosing `interval` for a series.** The only valid values are **`5m`, `1h`, `1d`** — anything
else 400s. The interval is **plan-gated as well as size-gated**: asking finer than your plan's floor
returns a **403**, not fewer points. **`5m` is max/ultra only; `pro` floors at `1h`; `free` floors at
`1d`.** Pick the coarsest interval that answers the question, and on a 403 step one rung coarser
(`5m` → `1h` → `1d`) rather than reporting no data. Guard the 50k-point cap — points ≈ span ÷ interval:

- hours to a few days → `5m` on max/ultra · `1h` on pro · `1d` on free
- about a week to a month → `1h` on max/ultra and pro · `1d` on free
- multiple months → `1d` (every plan)

`from`/`to` are ISO-8601 UTC. If the user says "last week", compute the range from today and state
the window you used. If a single call would exceed ~50k points, widen the interval or split the range.

### 3. Interpret the rows as measurements

When you present numbers, define each column with its catalog `description` / `howToRead` wording
(or the glossary). Convert quote-relative values to USD when helpful by multiplying by
`quoteUsdRate` (units are documented per metric). Anchor `ts` on the timeline. Compare windows in
plain measurement terms — "taker-buy volume was 2.3× taker-sell volume", "median resting-level
lifetime dropped from 4.1s to 0.6s" — and stop there. Do not translate a measurement into a buy/sell
call or label it with any banned word.

**Always read `qualityFlags`.** It is the one column that qualifies every other column on the row,
it is free on every plan, and it is deliberately queryable — request it alongside whatever else you
ask for. It is a **bitmask**: `0` means no known problem, and each set bit names one condition. The
full bit table ships on the catalog entry for `qualityFlags` as `bits`, and each bit carries a
`contaminates` list of the metric families it calls into question — so a broken order book leaves
the trade columns on the same row sound. Read the bit table from the catalog rather than hardcoding
bit numbers.

Nothing in a row is ever hidden, filtered or nulled. Every value is exactly as measured; the flags
tell you which of them to trust. Two companion columns are worth requesting with it:

- **`lastTradeAgeTime`** — how long before the window closed the pair last traded, `0` when the
  window itself contained a trade. About half of all windows contain no trade, and their candle
  carries the last traded price forward rather than inventing one. A large value means the price is
  real but old.
- **`bookObservedAt`** — the instant the book was actually read, which is later than the window
  close by a different amount on each venue. Use it, not `ts`, to line two venues up.

**The `QUALITY_UNKNOWN` flag (mask 32768) is not a defect.** It means the row predates the quality
rail and was never assessed — **unchecked, not unreliable**. It is the ClickHouse column default, so
the entire pre-migration-006 archive carries it. Say "not assessed", never "bad data".

Where a chart draws this, the convention is: **wherever the mark is fainter or hollow, that bucket
is flagged; solid means final.**

**Five columns that 400 the WHOLE request if you name them in `columns=`.** `quoteAsset`,
`baseAsset`, `enrichmentTs`, `bookSynced` and `missingTrades` are identity/state fields, not data
series. Naming any one of them fails the entire call — the columns you actually wanted included —
with `Unknown metric(s): …`. They arrive on their own in a full response; just never ask for them
by name. Use `qualityFlags` for the `bookSynced` / `missingTrades` concerns.

`bookAgeTime` and `seedDepth` are the opposite case: `internal: true`, they measure our collector
rather than the market, and the API **accepts-and-ignores** them, as it does the structural keys
`ts`, `exchange`, `symbol` and `ingestedAt`. Requesting those six is harmless.

### 4. Handle entitlements gracefully — omitted ≠ nonexistent

Entitlements (venues, columns, granularity, history depth) are enforced **server-side by plan**.
Three things to recognise and explain:

- A response header **`X-BlackForge-Columns-Omitted`** (or simply missing expected columns) means
  those columns sit **above the caller's plan** and were dropped — the data exists, the key just
  doesn't include it. Tell the user which tier includes them and point to **blackforge.so/pricing**.
  Never report it as "there is no data for that".
- A **`403`** on a venue or interval means the same at the request level (e.g. a `pro`-only venue on
  a free key, or a `5m` interval on a pro key, whose floor is `1h`). Explain the plan gap and the
  upgrade path. There is **no `1m` interval** — do not go looking for a plan that unlocks one.
- **History depth is clamped SILENTLY — there is no header and no error.** If you ask for a `from`
  earlier than the plan's window, the API quietly moves it forward to the plan's floor and returns
  a shorter `points` array. Nothing in the response says it happened, so a short series is
  ambiguous: it may be the plan's window, not the end of the data.

  **Never narrate this as retention.** "BlackForge only has data going back two weeks" is wrong and
  is the single easiest mistake to make here. **Retention is infinite — nothing is ever deleted.**
  The window is an *entitlement*: how far back this key may read. Compare the first timestamp you
  got against the `from` you asked for, and when it moved, say so — "your plan reads back 2 weeks,
  so the series starts there; the archive itself goes back further" — then point at
  **blackforge.so/pricing**.

`blackforge_usage` / `X-BlackForge-Rows-Remaining` tell you the monthly quota left; if a call fails
for quota, say so plainly.

### 5. Prefer MCP, fall back to CLI, else help them set up

1. If the **`blackforge_*` MCP tools** are available, use them — this is the primary path.
2. Otherwise, if the **`blackforge` CLI** is installed (or `npx -y @blackforge-so/cli` is usable), shell
   out to it and parse `--output json`.
3. If neither exists, don't hand-roll API calls — tell the user how to set one up and point them to
   [`references/setup.md`](references/setup.md) (MCP config block, CLI install, and where to get a
   key at app.blackforge.so → API).

## Worked examples

**"What's the resting depth for ETH on Binance right now?"**
→ `blackforge_catalog` to confirm `binance` and the depth metric keys → `blackforge_symbols` if
unsure of the symbol (`ETHUSDT`) → `blackforge_latest({exchange:'binance', symbol:'ETHUSDT',
columns:['price','downDepth5','downDepth10','upDepth30','upDepth100','qualityFlags']})`. Report each as its
measurement: "bid depth within −5% of top-of-book: \$X; ask depth to +30%: \$Y", noting they are
resting-liquidity sums in the quote currency at the last complete bucket for that key's plan
(5 min on max/ultra, 1 h on pro, 1 d on free), and reading `qualityFlags` before trusting them.

**"Chart the bid-ask spread for BTC-USDT on OKX last week."**
→ catalog — **there is no spread key.** Say so, then derive it: two `blackforge_series` calls
(`bestAsk` and `bestBid`) over the same range and subtract point by point. Use `interval:'1h'` for a
week (it is inside every paid plan's floor and stays well under the point cap; `5m` needs max/ultra
and 7 days of it approaches the cap anyway; a free key gets `1d`). State the window and the interval
you actually used, and describe the line as the measured quantity over time, not as a trade cue.

**"Compare taker buy vs sell volume for SOL on Binance today."**
→ two `blackforge_series` calls (`buyTradeVol`, `sellTradeVol`) or one `blackforge_latest` with both
columns → present the ratio as measured aggressor balance.
