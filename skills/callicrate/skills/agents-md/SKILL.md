# Manage AGENTS.md

`AGENTS.md` gives coding agents scoped, current, repo-specific instructions. It is not a README, runbook, architecture doc, changelog, tutorial, or evidence log. Good guidance is evidence-backed, concise, scoped to the file's directory tree, and behavioral: it tells agents what to do differently in this repository.

## When to Use

- Create, update, review, split, move, or repair a repository `AGENTS.md`.
- Capture verified local commands, repo contracts, path ownership, or recurring agent mistakes.
- Convert repo evidence into rules that future agents can follow.

## When NOT to Use

- Standalone skills, prompts, global instructions, READMEs, architecture docs, changelogs, or runbooks.
- Broad documentation rewrites where `AGENTS.md` is not an explicit deliverable.
- Aspirational process guidance that is not supported by current repo evidence.

## Modes

- **patch**: small text fix, typo, stale path, or narrow rule change. Inspect the affected section and evidence only.
- **create**: no suitable `AGENTS.md` exists. Run the analyzer, sample source/config/docs, then draft the smallest useful file.
- **update**: existing file needs new or corrected guidance. Preserve valid rules, remove stale or duplicated material, and add only evidenced changes.
- **split/move**: scope boundaries are changing. Inspect existing root and nested files, then use [references/topology-and-handoff-guidance.md](references/topology-and-handoff-guidance.md).
- **review**: do not edit unless asked. Return findings by severity with evidence and residual risk.
- **exhaustive**: monorepos, contract-heavy repos, safety-sensitive guidance, operational handoffs, major topology changes, or unclear evidence.

## Workflow

1. Pick the mode and target scope. Read the nearest existing `AGENTS.md`, nested `AGENTS.md` files that may overlap, and `git status --short` when available.
2. For create, update, split/move, or exhaustive modes, run `python <skill-root>/scripts/analyze_project.py --repo-root <target-repo> --format json`. Treat it as a sampling guide, not authority.
3. For normal authoring details, use [references/normal-authoring.md](references/normal-authoring.md). Inspect only the sources needed for the claims you will make.
4. Draft from the smallest applicable template in [references/template-selection.md](references/template-selection.md). Prefer [assets/agentsmd-minimal.md](assets/agentsmd-minimal.md) unless the repo clearly needs a specialized template.
5. Keep evidence in working notes or the final summary. Add an evidence file only when the repo already owns one or the user asks.
6. Validate with `python <skill-root>/scripts/validate_agentsmd.py --repo-root <target-repo> --agents-file <target-agents-file> --mode <quick|standard|exhaustive>` and `python <skill-root>/scripts/semantic_check_agentsmd.py --repo-root <target-repo> --agents-file <target-agents-file>`.

## Rule Quality Rubric

Keep a rule only when it is:

- **specific**: names actual paths, commands, contracts, or local conventions.
- **current**: supported by live files or user-provided current facts.
- **scoped**: applies to this `AGENTS.md` directory tree.
- **behavioral**: changes what an agent should do.
- **evidence-backed**: traceable to inspected repo evidence.
- **safe**: avoids secrets, unauthorized access, destructive commands, and production execution.
- **non-duplicative**: does not restate global instructions, language basics, or README content.
- **concise**: short enough to scan during normal coding work.

## Escalation Matrix

Load extra references only when the task needs them:

| Trigger | Read |
|---------|------|
| Tool, CLI, MCP, API, generated file, migration, schema, or public contract guidance | [references/contract-bearing-agentsmd.md](references/contract-bearing-agentsmd.md) |
| Split, move, nested scopes, stale topology, or ownership handoff | [references/topology-and-handoff-guidance.md](references/topology-and-handoff-guidance.md) |
| Live operations, degraded tools, manual dispatch, stop states, or environment resets | [references/degraded-tool-surface.md](references/degraded-tool-surface.md), [references/evidence-invalidation.md](references/evidence-invalidation.md) |
| Subagents or delegated review workflows | [references/subagent-coordination-patterns.md](references/subagent-coordination-patterns.md) |
| Python, TypeScript, other stack, Databricks/Spark, or ML-specific evidence prompts | [references/language-specific/python-guidance.md](references/language-specific/python-guidance.md), [references/language-specific/typescript-guidance.md](references/language-specific/typescript-guidance.md), [references/language-specific/other-stack-guidance.md](references/language-specific/other-stack-guidance.md), [references/domain-specific/databricks-spark.md](references/domain-specific/databricks-spark.md), [references/domain-specific/ml-projects.md](references/domain-specific/ml-projects.md) |
| Review-only or judgment-heavy audit | [references/manual-audit.md](references/manual-audit.md) |

## Final Response

For edit modes, include changed files, rules added/changed/removed, evidence sources sampled, validation commands and results, and residual risks.

For review mode, lead with findings ordered by severity. Each finding needs the affected `AGENTS.md` section or line, supporting repo evidence, why it matters, and the recommended fix. Then list open questions, test/validation gaps, and a brief summary only after findings.
