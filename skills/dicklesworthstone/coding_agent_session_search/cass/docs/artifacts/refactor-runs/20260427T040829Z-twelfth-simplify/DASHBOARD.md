## Verification Summary

- Focused tests passed for all ten passes.
- Touched-file `rustfmt --check` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed for the loop files and artifacts.
- `cargo check --all-targets` passed through `rch`.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` passed through `rch`.
- Full `cargo fmt --check` remains blocked by unrelated existing formatting drift in `tests/golden_robot_docs.rs`, `tests/golden_robot_json.rs`, and `tests/metamorphic_agent_detection.rs`.

## Preservation Notes

- No files were deleted.
- No new `rusqlite` usage was introduced.
- All changes are private helpers or test-only restructuring except for status/error helper extraction that preserves public protocol/error strings.
- Search/daemon/pages behavior was verified with targeted tests plus final check/clippy.
