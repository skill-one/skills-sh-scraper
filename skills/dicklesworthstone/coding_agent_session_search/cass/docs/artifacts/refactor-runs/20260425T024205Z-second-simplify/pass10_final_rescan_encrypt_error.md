# Pass 10/10 - Final Rescan and Dashboard

## Isomorphism Card

### Change

Replace the private `AeadSourceError` hand-written `Display` plus empty `Error` implementations in `src/pages/encrypt.rs` with `#[derive(thiserror::Error)]` and `#[error("{0}")]`.

### Equivalence Contract

- Inputs covered: AES-GCM errors wrapped for key unwrap and chunk decrypt diagnostics.
- Display text: unchanged. The previous implementation wrote `self.0` with `{}`; the derive format string also renders field `0` with `{}`.
- Error source behavior: unchanged. The previous `Error` impl did not override `source()`, and the derive has no `#[source]` or `#[from]` field.
- Public API / schema: unchanged. `AeadSourceError` is private to `src/pages/encrypt.rs`.
- Runtime behavior: unchanged apart from generated trait boilerplate.

### Candidate Score

- LOC saved: 7
- Confidence: 5
- Risk: 1
- Score: 35.0
- Decision: accept. This is private standard trait boilerplate with existing crypto diagnostic tests covering the relevant error-chain surface.

## Final Rescan Evidence

- Type-alias scan: remaining source aliases in `src/pages/export.rs`, `src/search/query.rs`, `src/ui/app.rs`, and `src/indexer/mod.rs` are large row/key aliases or public/compatibility-adjacent helpers; rejected as higher-risk for this final pass.
- Trait-boilerplate scan: `AeadSourceError` was private, local, and had an empty `Error` impl; accepted.
- Broader wrapper/default scans: rejected public CLI/robot/search helpers and documented TUI state helpers because their names carry local semantic weight.

## Files Changed

- `src/pages/encrypt.rs`: derived `thiserror::Error` for `AeadSourceError`.
- `refactor/artifacts/20260425T024205Z-second-simplify/pass10_final_rescan_encrypt_error.md`: this proof card.
- `refactor/artifacts/20260425T024205Z-second-simplify/DASHBOARD.md`: final run ledger.

## Fresh-Eyes Review

Great, now I want you to carefully read over all of the new code you just wrote and other existing code you just modified with "fresh eyes" looking super carefully for any obvious bugs, errors, problems, issues, confusion, etc. Carefully fix anything you uncover. Did you actually verify that everything was preserved according to the skill?

- Re-read both `AeadSourceError` construction sites.
- Confirmed the wrapper still appears as the anyhow chain frame under the contextual error.
- Confirmed no `#[source]`, `#[from]`, or `#[error(transparent)]` attribute was introduced, so source-chain semantics remain the same.
- Confirmed `thiserror` is already a project dependency and this change does not add crates.

## Verification

- Passed: `rustfmt --edition 2024 --check src/pages/encrypt.rs`
- Passed: `git diff --check -- src/pages/encrypt.rs refactor/artifacts/20260425T024205Z-second-simplify/pass10_final_rescan_encrypt_error.md`
- Passed: `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/rch_target_cass_second_simplify cargo test --lib pages::encrypt::tests::unwrap_key_chains_aead_source_error_into_diagnostic_message` (1 passed)
- Passed: final touched-file rustfmt check.
- Passed: `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/rch_target_cass_second_simplify cargo check --all-targets`
- Passed: `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/rch_target_cass_second_simplify cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- Full `cargo fmt --check`: red on pre-existing formatting drift in `tests/golden_robot_docs.rs`, `tests/golden_robot_json.rs`, and `tests/metamorphic_agent_detection.rs`.
