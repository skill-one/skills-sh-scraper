## Pass Ledger

| Pass | Mission | Commit | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Derive/Boilerplate Helper | `cb5ffa65` | Replaced `SetupError` manual display/source boilerplate with `thiserror` derive attributes. |
| 2 | Assertion Table | `5f577fc1` | Table-drove password strength bar/percent assertions. |
| 3 | Literal Consolidation | `1c962276` | Pinned built-in source filter spellings. |
| 4 | Projection Helper | `e808527e` | Named the JSON export envelope helper and pinned exact payload shape. |
| 5 | Default Chain | `81cf4172` | Named the pages config time-range option chain. |
| 6 | Error Constructor | `16431d81` | Centralized reranker registry failure construction with source parity coverage. |
| 7 | Wrapper Collapse | `a2086b18` | Removed a one-call pages export temp-path wrapper. |
| 8 | Fixture Helper | `8573e928` | Shared reranker registry tempdir fixture setup. |
| 9 | Enum/String Table | `8dcdae13` | Centralized password strength visual values. |
| 10 | Final Rescan and Dashboard | `ed7b0584` | Recorded final verification and convergence. |

## Final Verification

- Passed: `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/rch_target_cass_ninth_simplify cargo check --all-targets`
- Passed: `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/rch_target_cass_ninth_simplify cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- Known pre-existing blocker: `cargo fmt --check` still reports only formatting drift in:
  - `tests/golden_robot_docs.rs`
  - `tests/golden_robot_json.rs`
  - `tests/metamorphic_agent_detection.rs`

## Fresh-Eyes Review

- Re-read the touched-source summaries and pass proof cards after the broad gates.
- Confirmed all changed code stayed out of the pre-existing peer-owned `src/indexer/mod.rs` and `src/storage/sqlite.rs` work.
- Confirmed the pass 4 exact-shape test caught and fixed a stale expected fixture score before commit.
- Confirmed failed cargo invocations in passes 5 and 6 were command-shape mistakes only; both were rerun with valid module filters and passed.
- Confirmed no new `rusqlite` usage, no file deletion, no destructive git/filesystem action, and no bare `cass` invocation.

## Convergence

The final pass did not force another source edit. The remaining obvious small seams either had already been simplified in this or prior loops, crossed broader public-contract boundaries, or would have increased coupling more than they removed code. The run is complete with artifacts for every pass and broad Rust verification passing except the known unrelated format drift.
