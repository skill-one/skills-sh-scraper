## Fresh-Eyes Fixes

- Pass 5 removed two direct `panic!` surfaces in touched query tests while preserving failure behavior.
- Pass 9 replaced four direct `panic!` fallback branches in touched asset-state tests with assertion-based diagnostics.
- Pass 10 rechecked the final asset-state file state; UBS reports zero critical issues for the final changed Rust files.
- Pass 10 added local test type aliases for two earlier table matrices after final clippy surfaced tuple type complexity.

## Verification Summary

- Focused tests passed for each pass.
- `src/search/asset_state.rs` full module slice passed after passes 9 and 10.
- Touched-file rustfmt checks passed for all changed Rust files.
- `git diff --check` passed for each pass.
- UBS reported zero critical issues for passes 1-4 and 6-10.
- Pass 5 UBS remaining criticals were inspected false positives around `token` identifiers in existing query code; the direct `panic!` criticals found in the touched test module were fixed.

## Final Project Gates

- `git diff --check` passed.
- `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/rch_target_cass_fourteenth_simplify cargo check --all-targets` passed.
- `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/rch_target_cass_fourteenth_simplify cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` passed after local test type aliases for the pass 2 and pass 3 case matrices.
- `cargo fmt --check` remains red only on pre-existing formatting drift in `tests/golden_robot_docs.rs`, `tests/golden_robot_json.rs`, and `tests/metamorphic_agent_detection.rs`; this run did not touch or reformat those files.
- Final UBS on `src/search/model_manager.rs`, `src/search/semantic_manifest.rs`, `src/search/asset_state.rs`, and pass 10 artifacts exited 0 with zero critical issues.
