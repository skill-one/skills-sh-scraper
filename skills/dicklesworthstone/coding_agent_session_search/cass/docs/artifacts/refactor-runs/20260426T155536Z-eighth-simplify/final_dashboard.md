## Verification Summary

Passed:

- Focused verification for passes 1-10.
- `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/rch_target_cass_eighth_simplify cargo check --all-targets`
- `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/rch_target_cass_eighth_simplify cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`

Known pre-existing blocker:

- `cargo fmt --check` still fails only on the baseline formatting drift in
  `tests/golden_robot_docs.rs`, `tests/golden_robot_json.rs`, and
  `tests/metamorphic_agent_detection.rs`.

## Fresh-Eyes Closeout

Re-read all files touched in this run at the point of their pass and checked the
diffs against the isomorphism cards. The loop avoided dirty peer files
`src/indexer/mod.rs` and `src/storage/sqlite.rs`; those remain uncommitted by
this run.
