# CASS Performance Limits and Constraints

This document describes the tested performance limits and resource constraints for cass (Coding Agent Session Search).

## Archive Size Limits

| Archive Size | Conversations | Messages | Expected Performance |
|--------------|---------------|----------|---------------------|
| 10MB | 1,000 | 10,000 | Full performance, <1s search |
| 100MB | 10,000 | 100,000 | Search under 5s |
| 500MB | 50,000 | 500,000 | Search under 10s |
| 1GB+ | 100,000+ | 1,000,000+ | May require increased timeouts |

### Recommendations

- For archives under 10,000 conversations, expect near-instant search results
- For larger archives, use `--limit` to cap result count
- Consider using `--fields minimal` for faster response times with large result sets

## Message Size Limits

| Scenario | Limit | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Single message content | 1MB | Larger messages indexed but may be truncated in display |
| Messages per conversation | 10,000 | Practical limit for search performance |
| Total message count | 1,000,000+ | Tested with streaming indexer |

### Content Handling

- Messages over 1MB: Indexed fully, but TUI display may truncate
- Very long lines (>10,000 chars): Wrapped in display
- Binary content: Skipped during indexing

## Memory Usage

| Operation | Expected Memory | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Idle | ~50MB | Base application footprint |
| Search (10K docs) | ~100MB | Includes result caching |
| Search (100K docs) | ~200-300MB | May vary with result size |
| Full index rebuild | 500MB-1GB | Temporary spike during indexing |

### Memory Management

- LRU cache automatically evicts old entries
- Memory growth during search is bounded
- Explicit cleanup on index close

## Concurrent Operations

| Scenario | Tested Configuration | Performance |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| Parallel searches | 8 threads, 100 queries each | 100% success rate |
| Sustained load | 5 seconds continuous | Max latency <2s |
| High concurrency | 32 threads | 95%+ success rate |
| Search during indexing | Concurrent read/write | 90%+ search success |

### Thread Safety

- SearchClient is thread-safe (each thread should create its own instance)
- Index updates are atomic
- Reader reload is handled automatically

## Query Complexity Limits

| Query Type | Complexity | Expected Latency |
|------------|------------|------------------|
| Simple term | Low | <100ms |
| Prefix wildcard (`foo*`) | Low | <100ms (edge n-gram optimized) |
| Suffix wildcard (`*bar`) | Medium | <500ms |
| Substring (`*foo*`) | High | <1s |
| Boolean (AND/OR) | Medium | <500ms |
| Complex boolean | High | <2s |

### Query Recommendations

- Prefer prefix wildcards over suffix/substring when possible
- Use `--limit` to cap expensive queries
- Combine filters with queries to reduce search space

## Index Limits

| Metric | Limit | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Tantivy segments | Auto-merged at 4+ | Configurable |
| Schema changes | Trigger full rebuild | Versioned with hash |
| Concurrent writers | 1 | Tantivy limitation |
| Concurrent readers | Unlimited | Thread-safe |

## Network/Sync Limits (Remote Sources)

| Operation | Timeout | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| SSH connection | 10s | Configurable |
| rsync transfer | 5 min | For large initial syncs |
| SFTP fallback | Per-file | When rsync unavailable |

## Environment Variable Overrides

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `CASS_CACHE_SHARD_CAP` | 256 | Max entries per cache shard |
| `CASS_CACHE_TOTAL_CAP` | 2048 | Total cache entry limit |
| `CASS_CACHE_BYTE_CAP` | 0 (disabled) | Total cache byte limit |
| `CASS_PARALLEL_SEARCH` | 10000 | Threshold for parallel vector search |
| `CASS_WARM_DEBOUNCE_MS` | 120 | Debounce for warm worker |
| `CASS_SEMANTIC_EMBEDDER` | auto | Force hash/ml embedder |
| `CASS_STREAMING_INDEX` | true | Enable streaming indexer |

## Tested Configurations

### Load Test Results (from P6.9)

```
Archive Size Tests:
  - 1K conversations: PASS (search <1s)
  - 10K conversations: PASS (search <5s)
  - 50K conversations: PASS (search <10s)

Message Size Tests:
  - Large messages (1MB): PASS
  - Many small messages (100/conv): PASS

Memory Tests:
  - Bounded search: <100MB growth over 500 searches
  - Resource cleanup: <50MB retained after test

Concurrent Tests:
  - 8 threads parallel: 100% success
  - Sustained 5s load: Max latency <2s
  - 32 thread stress: 95%+ success
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Single writer**: Only one process can write to the index at a time
2. **No incremental schema migration**: Schema changes require full rebuild
3. **Memory-mapped files**: Large indexes need sufficient virtual memory
4. **macOS keychain**: ChatGPT decryption only works on macOS

## Troubleshooting

### Slow Searches

1. Check index health: `cass health --json`
2. Rebuild if needed: `cass index --full`
3. Use `--limit` to cap results
4. Try `--fields minimal` for faster response

### High Memory Usage

1. Reduce `CASS_CACHE_TOTAL_CAP`
2. Set `CASS_CACHE_BYTE_CAP` to limit cache memory
3. Restart to clear accumulated state

### Index Corruption

1. Run `cass health --json` to diagnose
2. If only derived search assets are stale or corrupt, run the index refresh recommended by health
3. Run `cass doctor check --json` if the canonical SQLite archive is unreadable or malformed
4. Check disk space availability
