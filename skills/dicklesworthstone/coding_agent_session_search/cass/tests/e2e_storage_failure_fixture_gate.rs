//! Storage-failure fixture suite + real-binary E2E regression gate.
//!
//! Bead `coding_agent_session_search-cass-fleet-resilience-20260608-uojcg.14.4`
//! (epic 14 — "Storage integrity, legacy DB interop, and concurrency-safe
//! repair"). Mandatory closure proof per `docs/RESILIENCE_TEST_MATRIX.md`:
//! `e2e` (the real `cass` binary), `fixtures` (one per storage failure class),
//! and `logs` (a per-fixture `proof_artifact` that distinguishes a real pass
//! from a timeout / generated-only).
//!
//! What this gate proves
//! ---------------------
//! The storage failure classes are high-risk and hard to reproduce against live
//! user data. This gate builds **deterministic fixtures** for every class the
//! bead enumerates, then drives the real `cass` binary against each and asserts
//! the resilience contract that is *true today*:
//!
//!   * **Canonical-broken classes** (openread / integrity / schema-drift /
//!     legacy-interop / stale-WAL-sidecar / busy-lock) — where the canonical
//!     archive can no longer be trusted or fingerprinted — `cass search` must
//!     **fail closed**: empty stdout, a structured `{error:{...}}` envelope on
//!     stderr whose `kind` is a storage error, and a process exit code that
//!     mirrors `error.code`. `cass status` stays a complete-and-report surface
//!     but is **honest**: it reports `health_level != "healthy"` and populates
//!     `database.open_error` instead of claiming a broken archive is fine.
//!   * **Derived-only classes** (FTS-metadata mismatch / stale cached searcher
//!     after lexical publish) — where the canonical rows survive and only a
//!     *derived* asset drifted — `cass search` must **fail open**: it rebuilds
//!     the lexical index from SQLite (the source-of-truth contract) and returns
//!     truthful results, and `status` stays healthy.
//!   * **Source-of-truth preservation (the strongest invariant).** Across every
//!     fixture the canonical `agent_search.db` is *never deleted and never
//!     rewritten* by a read/diagnostic surface. For canonical-broken fixtures
//!     the gate asserts the DB is **byte-identical** before and after the probe
//!     (a real `never_deletes_source_evidence` proof — empirically the search
//!     path leaves the corrupt DB hash unchanged).
//!   * **Missing ≠ corrupt.** An *uninitialized* data dir reports
//!     `missing-index` (code 3, "run index --full"); a *present-but-corrupt*
//!     archive reports a storage error (code 5).
//!     [`missing_db_is_distinct_from_corrupt_db`] pins that the two are distinct
//!     kinds *and* codes, so the binary never conflates "no archive yet" with
//!     "archive is broken" — collapsing them would risk a destructive
//!     from-scratch rebuild that discards a recoverable archive (the `.15.6`
//!     partial-proceed lock-in, on the storage surface).
//!
//! Relationship to the storage taxonomy (`.14.1`)
//! ----------------------------------------------
//! `.14.1` (`src/search/storage_integrity.rs`) defines the `StorageState` /
//! `SourceOfTruthRisk` vocabulary that doctor/status/search-meta *project*. As
//! of bead `vl1cj` that projection is **live**: `cass doctor --check --json`
//! emits a `storage_integrity` block (`storage_state` / `source_of_truth_risk` /
//! `archive_readability` + read-only `checks_attempted`), derived from doctor's
//! existing read-only db-open / integrity / FTS / lexical-index signals.
//! [`doctor_check_projects_storage_state_per_fixture`] preserves the coarse
//! open-failure expectation for the original deliberately unreadable fixtures.
//! [`dedicated_openable_fixtures_are_exact_across_status_search_and_doctor`]
//! separately uses structurally openable schema/legacy/sidecar fixtures and a
//! real typed-lock fixture to pin `schema_drift`, `legacy_interop_failed`,
//! `wal_sidecar_suspect`, and `busy_or_locked` exactly.
//!
//! Attribution
//! -----------
//! Every surface runs through the shared `.12.2` bounded runner
//! ([`spawn_with_timeout_or_diag`]), which keeps stdout/stderr separate and
//! turns a hang into a loud `TIMEOUT DIAGNOSTIC` + panic — categorically
//! distinct from this gate's `Err` (assertion fail) and `Ok` (pass). A failed
//! probe is attributed to one of the four bead categories — CASS, frankensqlite
//! storage, host-pressure, or fixture-setup — by [`attribute_failure`], proven
//! by [`failure_attribution_separates_the_four_categories`].
//!
//! Isolation
//! ---------
//! Every invocation runs against a fresh `tempdir` with `HOME`/`XDG_*`/cwd
//! redirected into it, `CASS_IGNORE_SOURCES_CONFIG=1`, and the hash embedder, so
//! the gate never scans the operator's real corpus or downloads a model. The
//! one baseline index is built once and copied per fixture so corruptions never
//! leak across fixtures.
