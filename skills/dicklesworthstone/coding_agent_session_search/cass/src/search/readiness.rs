#![allow(dead_code)]

//! Truthful readiness-state vocabulary for lexical vs. semantic search
//! (bead ibuuh.9).
//!
//! Today cass reports a single "healthy / unhealthy" bit that conflates
//! "lexical index missing" (actually broken — search returns nothing),
//! "lexical index stale but searchable" (slightly old but fully correct),
//! "lexical index rebuilding in background" (search works, new content
//! will land shortly), and "semantic tier still backfilling" (lexical
//! results are complete, hybrid refinement catches up later). Agents and
//! humans keep triggering unnecessary repair rituals because the single
//! health bit cannot distinguish these cases.
//!
//! This module lands the vocabulary that future status/capabilities/
//! search-metadata payloads will project into their JSON. The fields are
//! intentionally orthogonal — lexical readiness and semantic readiness
//! are independent dimensions, and the user-facing `recommended_action`
//! is derived from their combination rather than dropping them behind a
//! single scalar.
//!
//! Invariants the types enforce:
//! - `LexicalReadinessState` covers the five states any agent must be
//!   able to distinguish: `Missing`, `Repairing`, `StaleButSearchable`,
//!   `Ready`, `CorruptQuarantined`. Ordinary search is correct in
//!   `StaleButSearchable` and `Ready` (and degrading-but-serving in
//!   `Repairing`); it is only unavailable in `Missing` and
//!   `CorruptQuarantined`.
//! - `SemanticReadinessState` covers `Absent`, `Backfilling`,
//!   `FastTierReady`, `HybridReady`, `PolicyDisabled`. Absence and
//!   policy-disabled both mean "no semantic refinement" but have
//!   different operator implications.
//! - `SearchRefinementLevel` describes what a PARTICULAR completed
//!   search actually returned (`LexicalOnly`, `FastTierRefined`,
//!   `FullyHybridRefined`). This is independent of the tier
//!   *readiness* above — a search may be `LexicalOnly` either because
//!   the semantic tier was absent or because the planner chose not to
//!   refine.
//! - `ReadinessSnapshot` groups all three plus a
//!   `RecommendedAction` so every downstream consumer (CLI, TUI,
//!   robot) derives its summary from the same canonical source.
