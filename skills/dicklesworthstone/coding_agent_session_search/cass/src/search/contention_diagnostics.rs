// Dead-code tolerated module-wide: this concurrency / busy-lock / WAL-sidecar /

// lands the classification contract ahead of its projection into the

// E2E gate (.14.4). It populates the .14.1 StorageState taxonomy that the .14.2
// salvage planner already consumes.
#![allow(dead_code)]

//! Concurrency, busy-lock, WAL-sidecar, and stale-cache contention
//! diagnostics (bead cass-fleet-resilience-20260608-uojcg.14.3).
//!
//! Several failure classes are *contention or transient sidecar state*, not
//! corrupt user data: the CLI, daemon, and indexer can collide on busy locks;
//! a killed process can leave a hot WAL/SHM sidecar; a cached searcher can
//! serve an old segment generation after a publish. cass must explain
//! contention **as contention** — with bounded retry/wait guidance — rather
//! than as missing data or archive loss.
//!
//! This module is the classification contract:
//! - [`ContentionClass`] separates busy/locked, busy-recovery, snapshot
//!   conflict, stale WAL/SHM sidecar, stale searcher/cache, and host-pressure.
//! - [`classify_franken_error`] maps a real `crate::franken_sync::FrankenError` to
//!   its contention class (or `None` when the error is not contention — e.g.
//!   corruption, which is a `.14.1` integrity state, not a transient).
//! - [`Retryability`] + [`BoundedWaitGuidance`] give retry/backoff advice that
//!   is **always bounded** — robot commands never block indefinitely.
//! - [`CacheStaleness`] classifies a cached searcher relative to the published
//!   generation; a stale cache is *invalidated/reported*, never treated as
//!   archive loss.
//! - [`ContentionReport`] is the projected verdict: class, retryability,
//!   bounded wait, the [`StorageState`] it maps to, best-effort
//!   [`LockEvidence`], a concrete (never bare/destructive) recommended
//!   command, and the "contention, not missing data" explanation.
//!
//! The invariant every consumer can assert: [`ContentionClass::is_archive_loss`]
//! is **always false**. All enums serialize as snake_case.
