//! Bounded fleet-doctor JSON contract.
//!
//! Bead: coding_agent_session_search-cass-fleet-resilience-20260608-uojcg.6.1
//! ("Define bounded fleet doctor probe schema").
//!
//! This module defines the wire contract for `cass`'s fleet doctor *before* the
//! probe implementation lands, so the producers (`6.2` cheap bounded probes,
//! `8.2` reachability/sync health) and consumers (`6.3` version skew, `6.4`
//! archive coverage, `9.2` root-cause projection, `10.4` per-host incident
//! rollups) all agree on one shape.
//!
//! The defining constraint is **boundedness without loss of host identity**: a
//! fleet sweep contacts many hosts, any of which may be slow, unreachable, or
//! running an old binary. The schema must therefore represent every outcome —
//! success, partial, timeout, old-binary skew, command-not-found, unreachable
//! SSH, macOS path/tool differences, and high archive risk — while *always*
//! preserving who the host is ([`HostDoctorReport::host_alias`] and
//! [`HostDoctorReport::platform`] are non-optional and survive every failure
//! mode). Deep state that could not be probed is `None`/empty and the omission
//! is recorded in [`HostDoctorReport::skipped_sections`], never silently dropped.
//!
//! Every field a diagnostic needs is structured and prose-free; a coarse,
//! optional [`RootCauseFamily`] hint composes with the attribution taxonomy from
//! bead `9.1` so `9.2` can project a likely root cause without changing this
//! contract.
