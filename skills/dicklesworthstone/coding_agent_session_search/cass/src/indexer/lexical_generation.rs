// Allow dead-code warnings for this module until downstream slices wire the

// and crash-resume lands.
#![allow(dead_code)]

//! Lexical generation manifests and publish-state vocabulary (bead ibuuh.30).
//!
//! The authoritative lexical rebuild pipeline from bead ibuuh.29 emits an
//! equivalence ledger proving what it ingested, but publish semantics are still
//! "one mutable `<data_dir>/index` directory". That leaves ordinary search
//! vulnerable to half-built artifacts during rebuild, crash, or parallel
//! experimentation.
//!
//! This module lands the *vocabulary* for the generation-based publish path:
//! a versioned manifest that describes a single lexical generation's
//! identity, build state, publish state, source fingerprint, and failure
//! history, plus atomic load / store helpers. It is intentionally isolated
//! from the rebuild pipeline in this slice; downstream slices will wire the
//! authoritative rebuild to produce these manifests in scratch directories,
//! promote them to `published`, and teach startup recovery to choose the
//! right generation.
//!
//! Invariants the type enforces:
//! - The schema version is explicit so future migrations can refuse or
//!   upgrade older manifests cleanly.
//! - Build state and publish state are independent enums so the lifecycle
//!   ("built but not yet validated", "validated but not yet published",
//!   "published but superseded") is representable without overloading a
//!   single state field.
//! - Failure history is an append-only log so crash-resume tooling can see
//!   why previous attempts were abandoned, including which attempt id, at
//!   which phase, and with what message.
//! - Counts and fingerprints live alongside state so a single manifest
//!   answers both "is this generation safe to serve?" and "does it
//!   correspond to the expected DB?".
