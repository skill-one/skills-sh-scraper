//! Bounded, resumable retry of retry-eligible quarantine entries (bead
//! cass-fleet-resilience-20260608-uojcg.3.2).
//!
//! The report's local node showed 133 irreducible ingest-OOM quarantines plus a
//! tail of legacy (`#258`, no `cass_version_at_quarantine`) and version-stale
//! entries. `.3.1`'s [`quarantine_status`](crate::search::quarantine_status)
//! surface lets an agent *see* which entries are retry-eligible; this module is
//! the matching *action*: a bounded, resumable retry that re-attempts only the
//! eligible (legacy / version-stale) entries, leaves irreducible same-version
//! entries untouched, skips entries whose source log is gone, and re-quarantines
//! anything that OOMs again.
//!
//! Two pure entry points mirror the dry-run / execute split the bead requires:
//!
//! - [`plan_retry`] is the **dry-run / plan**: it classifies every quarantine
//!   entry into a [`PlannedDisposition`] (retry / skip-irreducible /
//!   skip-source-missing / skip-budget-exhausted) without mutating anything or
//!   touching disk. Serialise its [`RetryPlan`] for `--dry-run` JSON.
//! - [`execute_retry`] walks that same plan and invokes a caller-supplied
//!   re-ingest function for each `Retry` entry, recording a per-entry
//!   [`RetryOutcome`], clearing the quarantine record on success and
//!   re-quarantining (which stamps the current version, demoting the entry to
//!   irreducible same-version) on OOM/failure.
//!
//! Bounding is the whole point: `max_attempts` caps the work so a 100k-entry
//! corpus never turns one command into an unbounded re-ingest storm — deferred
//! eligible entries are reported as `skipped_budget_exhausted`, never silently
//! dropped. Resumption needs no separate checkpoint file: the durable
//! `quarantine_state.json` *is* the checkpoint. Cleared entries are gone and
//! re-quarantined entries are now same-version, so a second pass naturally
//! re-plans against the shrunken eligible set and only attempts what is left.
//!
//! Non-goals (enforced here): never clear an irreducible entry silently — the
//! `eligible_only` contract defaults on, and the only way to attempt an
//! irreducible entry is the explicit `eligible_only=false` operator override;
//! never delete a source log; never trigger a full index rebuild when a targeted
//! retry suffices. All enums serialise snake_case; `next_safe_command` is always
//! a safe, non-destructive pointer.
