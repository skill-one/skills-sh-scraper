# Implement

Implement the accepted outcome. Repair ordinary known defects directly. Use the existing
intent; no Plan, Recall or Learn worksheet is owed for a clear edit. Implement
owns source changes and factual checks; the runtime derives identity and receipts.

## Workflow

1. Read intent, acceptance, scope and repository boundaries before the first
   write; reuse loaded contracts. RPI [boundaries](../rpi/references/boundaries.md)
   apply when that workflow is explicitly selected.
   For caller-selected episode tracking, obtain permitted work/source references
   and return observed runtime/context identity at startup through the native
   recording channel. Keep unknowns and failures explicit; invent no parentage
   or second tracker. The
   [session association reference](../cass/references/SESSION_FORMATS.md#work-to-session-associations)
   supplies mechanics for that selected workflow.
2. Carry the accepted behavior examples forward unchanged. Use repository
   domain names in symbols and tests; check observable outcomes through the
   relevant interface. Find actual consumers of edited paths or wording and
   their checks. For retirement, inspect live code, tests, schemas, instructions,
   installations and lookups as relevant; verify new guidance and old-name
   lookup behavior, preserving historical provenance. Keep exact check commands
   and the required integration recipe in the existing handoff. Run the smallest
   applicable check before and after editing. Behavioral changes preserve RED
   for the expected missing behavior; pure refactors, relocations or docs may
   have an honest green baseline. Prefer existing tests or small discriminating probes.
3. Make the smallest in-scope change. When repairing discovery or checks,
   preserve the consumer's existing input selection; fixing an error path does
   not authorize a wider scan. Use a negative control when exclusion matters.
   Check a representative change against existing constraints before bulk
   propagation; check the authored source set before broad regeneration.
   Repair known failures directly and verify the exact result (such as a cited
   file, assertion or returned record) before another review. A disproved assumption
   may change the approach within scope; use Plan only for consequential uncertainty.
4. Use targeted tests and applicable repository lint/static checks before
   broad integration. Read the repository's actual check recipe, including
   instrumentation and environment, rather than reconstructing it from memory.
   Run required full checks at integration. Reuse
   exact-input receipts only while source, tool and relevant environment match.
   Distinguish repository-mandated hook checks from discretionary repeats;
   neither bypass required hooks nor replay a check just to rename its receipt.
   A required CI job's known failure is actionable before the whole run ends.
   Inspect and repair it within scope; preserve the failed subject's evidence
   and rerun affected checks on the repair. Pending jobs do not imply success.
5. Refactor while acceptance remains green. Inspect changed tests, fixtures,
   goldens, tolerances, suppressions and specification text against original
   intent. Mocks, placeholders or weakened oracles cannot substitute for the
   requested behavior.
6. Have the runtime derive actual changed paths and content identity. A delegated
   increment awaiting integration returns an exact commit or runtime-derived
   content digests, author context ID and check facts in the existing handoff.
   The integrating caller derives `subject-manifest.v1` over the complete final
   subject before judgment; an independently judged increment needs its own
   manifest. Do not generate both merely because work was delegated.
   At that boundary, when changed paths affect bound acceptance evidence, run
   `ao provenance evidence-orphans --root <repo-root>` with one `--changed
   <path>` per derived path and retain its actual output. Refresh affected
   bindings after repairs; never invent or suppress the orphan list.
7. Return identity, check commands/results, useful failures and accessible
   evidence references through the native handoff, then stop. Keep full logs
   at their source, without duplicating inventories or status documents.
   Missing or truncated evidence stays explicit.

## Diagnosis, scaffolding and delegated work

For an unexplained failure, first match the reported symptom and reduce the
reproduction. State one causal prediction, test it with a discriminating check,
and repair the cause supported by the result. Rerun the original scenario.
Do not keep collecting hypotheses after the cause is understood. This compact
diagnosis path is informed by
[Matt Pocock's engineering skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills).

When scaffolding is the requested change, start from the repository's existing
layout and a working vertical slice. See [scaffold references](references/scaffold/agent-facing-tool-scaffolds.md)
only for the relevant tool shape. Avoid placeholder success paths and a new
framework for a one-off operation.

Prefer current-session execution. If delegation is authorized and useful,
partition independent writes in isolated workspaces; shared generators and
integration serialize. Supply each lane its intent, acceptance, scope and review
owner, then integrate its exact content and check facts. A selected wave ends with the
caller-requested wave result; do not invent another wave. One fresh review of
the integrated candidate can cover unjudged increments; when the integrator
owns that review, workers return their handoff without commissioning another.
Preserve any separately required lane judgments; a successful process exit is
not semantic PASS.
[Agent Native](../agent-native/SKILL.md) supplies optional dispatch mechanics.

An explicitly requested one-shot adapter dispatches each supplied operation
once, reports its output or error, and stops. Show dispatch count and failure
reporting with a dry-run or fixture. It does not silently acquire a scheduler,
retry controller or store. Factories require the caller's selection.

## Scope and finish

Report an uncovered live consumer as `file:line` for a caller scope amendment;
continue independent authorized work. Generated companions already included as
scope require no new approval. Acceptance changes always require caller authority.

Specialists advise only. Known defects stay implementation work; a genuine
causal stall permits at most one bounded fresh helper within caller authority.
Respect remaining caller/native bounds and reserve finishing capacity; retries reset neither.

Return facts, not semantic PASS. An implement-only handoff does not authorize
Git, tracker or delivery transitions; existing caller authority remains usable.
A full outcome request continues through fresh independent final judgment;
RPI is optional and explicitly selected. Success is working behavior with usable
evidence, not volume of logs or process artifacts.

[Generic scaffold examples](references/scaffold/generic-templates.md) are
optional starting points when the repository has no suitable existing pattern.
