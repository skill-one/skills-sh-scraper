# RPI

Own the authorized outcome through finish. Use the native coding agent and
shell. BD or the caller's tracker owns work and handoffs; Git owns content and
delivery. AgentOps supplies a small charter and fresh judgment, not a scheduler.

## Operating charter

1. Use the existing accepted outcome, scope and real bounds. A clear change
   needs no Plan, Recall or Learn worksheet. Resolve uncertainty only when it
   could change the implementation or acceptance decision.
2. Take the smallest acceptance-advancing action. [Plan](../plan/SKILL.md)
   shapes missing intent or revises a disproved approach. Once an implementer
   can act and a validator can judge, implement; do not keep improving the plan.
   Approach revisions preserve acceptance and authorized scope.
   Acceptance changes need caller authority.
3. [Implement](../implement/SKILL.md) and repair ordinary known defects directly.
   A known test failure needs a fix and a discriminating check, not another
   planning phase, council or helper.
4. Use focused checks during edits and complete required integration checks
   before final judgment. Reuse valid exact-input receipts; rerun affected
   checks after changes. Reserve capacity for integration, review and repair.
   Keep the final subject unchanged while it is being judged.
5. Obtain [Validate](../validate/SKILL.md) from one fresh author-distinct context
   in the author's model family unless the caller selects required additional
   legs. There is no fixed ten-minute cap; explicitly required
   reviewers remain required. Risk deepens evidence, not reviewer multiplication. Repair
   actionable findings within authority and remaining bounds, then revalidate
   the changed exact subject.
6. Stop at completed acceptance, cancellation, refusal, a spent real bound or
   an unresolved causal stall after the help below. Adjacent improvements are
   not permission to expand the goal. Report them briefly only when useful;
   do not turn them into another work batch.

## Context and handoffs

Load required contracts once per context, then read only what the next decision
needs. A reference link is available context, not a reading list. Search before
opening large files; expand only for consequential uncertainty. Keep successful
output compact at the tool boundary; retain full logs for inspection. Reuse the
worker's component-check list and current receipts instead of rediscovering them.
Use native completion watches or bounded waits for ongoing checks and helpers.
At completion, verify the expected subject and required results; a quiet or
partial status is not success. Inspect further for a failure, suspected stall or
decision need. Keep required user updates concise rather than narrating each poll.

When delegation is authorized and useful, select the runtime's task-only
dispatch option for independent work; a short prompt in a full-history fork
still carries full history. Supply accepted intent/scope, exact subject,
relevant evidence, remaining bounds, result consumer and check ownership.
Resume an author for direct repair when useful. Validators always receive fresh
context without the author's desired verdict. Observe actual dispatch settings;
prompt wording proves neither isolation nor smaller inherited context.

Return concise findings, check facts and evidence references in the existing
handoff; disclose missing or truncated evidence. Derive the combined subject's
manifest and applicable orphan scan at the integration/judgment boundary.
Unjudged worker increments supply content identity and check facts, not duplicate
final evidence bundles. A separately judged subject still needs complete proof.
Machine evidence such as `verdict.v2` is optional
unless requested or required by a declared consumer. When no machine
artifact is requested or required, return the result without creating one.

## Causal stall and bounds

Unknown cause, recurrence, no progress or a wrong objective admits
at most one bounded fresh helper for that incident within authority and bounds.
Give it the failed assumption, evidence and one discriminating question. Resume
only with a different testable approach; an unhelpful answer ends the attempt.
Do not chain helpers or rename the incident. Known failures get direct repair.
Cancellation, refusal and spent hard time/cost/quota skip help.

Respect actual caller/native limits, including explicit repair-round bounds.
Retries, compaction, helpers and new subjects never renew them; retry count
alone is not a spent budget. If interruption threatens evidence, preserve
accepted intent, exact subject, useful receipts, unresolved cause, bounds and
helper use in the native handoff. Prompt text proves no native enforcement.
[Outer-goal guidance](references/outer-goal.md) remains optional.

## Evidence and boundaries

Bind accepted intent, complete changed paths, exact subject and factual receipts
for the fresh validator; disclose affected orphaned acceptance evidence. Use
existing provenance helpers rather than a new evidence format. Requested proof
uses caller-selected protected external non-Git storage; preserve legacy
`.agents/` evidence. Missing identity, freshness or proof means NOT_PROVEN;
proven failed acceptance or scope violation means FAIL. PASS needs every
criterion verified and empty `not_checked`. Authors cannot issue binding PASS.

[Memory](../memory/SKILL.md), specialists and runtime adapters are on demand;
no-match and no-change are valid. Read [boundaries](references/boundaries.md)
when authority, scope, evidence or delivery is at issue. The optional
[fixed-dispatch adapter](references/bounded-adapter.md) is not the native
execution engine. Do not invent a runtime, hidden machine artifact or workflow
to finish an ordinary change.

Report the result, strongest checks and material limits. Plans, activity,
reviews and saved pages earn no capability credit; NOT_PLANNED and NOT_BUILT
are progress descriptions, not semantic verdicts.
