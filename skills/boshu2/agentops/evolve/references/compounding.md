# How Compounding Works

Two mechanisms feed the loop:

**1. Knowledge flywheel (each cycle is smarter):**
```
Session 1:
  ao lookup --query "recent learnings" (nothing yet)  → cycle runs blind
  /rpi fixes test-pass-rate       → postmortem runs ao forge
  Learnings extracted: "tests/skills/run-all.sh validates frontmatter"

Session 2:
  ao lookup --query "recent learnings" (loads Session 1 learnings)  → cycle knows about frontmatter validation
  /rpi fixes doc-coverage                → approach informed by prior learning
  Learnings extracted: "references/ dirs need at least one .md file"
```

**2. Work harvesting (each cycle discovers the next):**
```
Cycle 1: /rpi fixes test-pass-rate
  → postmortem harvests: "add missing smoke test for /evolve" → next-work.jsonl

Cycle 2: all GOALS.yaml goals pass
  → /evolve reads next-work.jsonl (exact repo first, then cross-repo '*', then legacy)
  → picks "add missing smoke test"
  → /rpi fixes it → postmortem harvests: "update SKILL-TIERS count"

Cycle 3: reads next-work.jsonl → picks "update SKILL-TIERS count" → ...
```

The loop keeps running as long as postmortem keeps finding follow-up work. Each /rpi cycle generates next-work items from its own postmortem. The system feeds itself.

**Priority cascade:**
```
next-work.jsonl (harvested / queued work)    → exact repo first, then `*`, then legacy
Open beads (ao beads exec ready)                        → durable tracked backlog
GOALS.yaml directives and failing goals      → explicit fitness gaps
Testing improvements                         → synthesize coverage / regression-test work
Validation + bug-hunt passes                 → tighten gates, discover real defects
Hotspots / TODO / drift / stale docs         → mine weak signals into work
Feature suggestions                          → propose new product work when remediation dries up
multiple empty queue + generator passes      → last-resort dormancy
60-minute circuit breaker                    → stop if no productive cycle in 60 min
kill switch                                  → immediate stop
```

The loop does NOT stop just because goals are met or the current queue is empty. It re-reads harvested work after every `/rpi` cycle, runs generator layers when queues are empty, and only stops after repeated empty queue + generator passes. Idle cycles are NOT committed to git — only appended locally. The idle streak is re-derived from disk at each session start, while `session-state.json` carries pending claim/generator resume state. Use the kill switch for intentional stops.

## Compounding is a tracked hypothesis, not a settled property (added 2026-07-07)

The two mechanisms above describe *how* a cycle could get smarter. Whether those cycles
**compound into a durable knowledge moat** is DEMOTED to an unproven hypothesis facing a
structural data-starvation headwind: a *competent* membrane catches at review, so escapes
(a CONFIRMED verdict later proved wrong) are structurally rare — measured 0 escapes across
130 real production verdicts — which makes self-improvement *anti-correlated* with membrane
quality. The corpus/flywheel it compiles inherits the same unproven position. See
[ADR-0004](../../../docs/adr/ADR-0004-corpus-moat-unproven-position-on-the-system.md) (corpus
moat unproven) and
[ADR-0011](../../../docs/adr/ADR-0011-escape-corpus-compounding-unproven-structural-starvation.md)
(escape-corpus compounding unproven / structural starvation).

**Posture for this skill:** the proven product is the per-cycle verification (**no verdict =
not done**); compounding is the *tracked hypothesis*, not the promise. Do not market the
flywheel ahead of the ruler. Mechanical corpus surfaces live on the CLI (`ao compile`,
`ao flywheel status`), harvested into the loop by `/postmortem` — the retired `/curate`,
`/compile`, and `/flywheel` skills folded into it (2026-07-07 wave).
