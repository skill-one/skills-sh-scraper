# nushell-pro

Nushell best practices, security hardening, and code review skill for Agents.

Write idiomatic, performant, secure, and maintainable [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) scripts — with built-in code review, anti-pattern detection, and Bash-to-Nushell conversion.

## Features

- **Best Practices** — Naming conventions, type annotations, I/O signatures, functional pipeline style, string format priority, and formatting rules
- **Security Hardening** — Injection prevention, path traversal protection, credential scoping, safe file/temp operations, environment sanitization
- **Stable CLI Tests** — PTY-width-independent assertions for nested Nushell diagnostics
- **IDE Diagnostics** — JSONL-aware `nu --ide-check` validation that catches errors even when the process exits successfully
- **Daemon & E2E Smoke Tests** — Deadline-based readiness checks, isolated state, tracked jobs/PIDs, and guaranteed cleanup
- **Evidence-Driven Code Review** — Version-aware findings with concrete triggers, impact, reproduction evidence, precise locations, and severity
- **Anti-Pattern Detection** — 35 common mistakes with idiomatic fixes
- **Type System** — Type hierarchy, complex types, type guards, null safety patterns
- **Nu 0.114 Support** — Stricter type checking, explicit submodule imports, `run`, POSIX `--`, SemVer, spreadsheet import changes, and updated diagnostics
- **Nu 0.115 Support** — YAML 1.2 contracts, `external_arg`, row conditions, binary filesize slicing, SemVer comparisons, null grouping, test migrations, and reproduction-verified workarounds for known 0.115.0 defects
- **Bash Conversion** — Side-by-side Bash-to-Nushell translation guide
- **Performance** — Parallel processing with `par-each`, streaming patterns, memory-efficient techniques
- **Data Processing** — Polars dataframes (lazy/eager), group-by, joins, window/sequence ops, nested list/struct data, reshaping, binning, time zones, SQL, column selectors, and large-data / columnar analytics

`SKILL.md` is always loaded into context. Reference files are loaded on demand when the task requires deeper knowledge on a specific topic.

## What It Covers

### Core Principles

1. Think in pipelines — data flows through functional transformations
2. Immutability first — `let` by default, `mut` only when necessary
3. Structured data — tables, records, and lists over string parsing
4. Static parsing — `source`/`use` require parse-time constants
5. Implicit return — last expression is the return value
6. Scoped environment — `def --env` when caller-side changes are needed
7. Type safety — annotate parameters and I/O signatures
8. Prefer `match` for branching — avoid long `if`/`else if` chains when dispatching on one value
9. Parallel ready — immutable code enables easy `par-each`

### Security Model

Nushell is safer than Bash by design (no `eval`, arguments passed as arrays), but risks remain:

| Risk Level | Threats                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Critical   | Code injection via `nu -c`, `^sh -c`, plugin injection            |
| High       | Path traversal, credential leaks, PATH hijacking, glob injection  |
| Medium     | TOCTOU races, temp file races, unhandled errors, config tampering |

### Script Review

The skill includes a version-aware review method plus a 5-category checklist:

1. **Security** (critical) — injection, paths, credentials, destructive ops
2. **Correctness** — types, errors, null safety, logic
3. **Style** — naming, strings, formatting, documentation
4. **Performance** — parallelism, streaming, caching
5. **Robustness** — input validation, file safety, process management

## Validation

```bash
nu --no-config-file --ide-check 100 tests/validation-and-daemon-smoke.nu
nu --no-config-file tests/validation-and-daemon-smoke.nu
nu --no-config-file --ide-check 100 tests/nu-0.115-smoke.nu
nu --no-config-file tests/nu-0.115-smoke.nu
```

The executable smoke tests cover JSONL IDE diagnostics, controlled job/process
cleanup, YAML 1.2 boundaries, high-frequency 0.115 commands, null grouping,
SemVer edge cases, and raw script CLI arguments. They also lock two Nu 0.115.0
defects — `to yaml --non-roundtrip 'lossy'` being rejected, and a nested
`finally` being skipped — so the guidance is retracted as soon as a patched Nu
makes those assertions fail.
