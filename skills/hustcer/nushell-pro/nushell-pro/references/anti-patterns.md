# Nushell Anti-Patterns Reference

Common mistakes and their idiomatic fixes when writing Nushell scripts.

## Contents

- 1–10: Return values, loops, mutation, imports, redirection, types, closures, environment, and strings
- 11–20: Parallelism, documentation, defaults, structured data, branching, modules, pipeline input, records, and null safety
- 21–27: External commands, errors, collections, large data, parsing, multiline flags, and format strings
- 28–34: Nu 0.114 migrations, SemVer, error records, spreadsheets, and stable diagnostic assertions
- 35: Literal parentheses inside string interpolation

## 1. Using `echo` Instead of Implicit Return

Nushell implicitly returns the last expression's value. `echo` is almost never needed.

```nu
# Bad
def greet [name: string]: nothing -> string {
    echo $'Hello, ($name)!'
}

# Good
def greet [name: string]: nothing -> string {
    $'Hello, ($name)!'
}
```

Use `print` when you want to display a message as a side effect (not as return value):

```nu
def process [] {
    print 'Processing...'    # Side effect: displayed to user
    do-work                  # Return value: result of do-work
}
```

**Bash-migration trap — `echo` is not `print`.** Unlike Bash's `echo`,
Nushell's `echo` only _produces a pipeline value_; it does not print as a side
effect. That value is rendered only when it becomes final output. Used as a
non-final statement, the value is silently discarded — so `echo 'msg'` meant as a
"print this" statement displays **nothing**:

```nu
# Bad — nothing is printed; the echo value is dropped before exit
if (has-ref $version) {
    echo $'Version ($version) already exists'   # silently discarded!
    exit 1
}

# Good — print writes to stdout as a side effect
if (has-ref $version) {
    print $'Version ($version) already exists'
    exit 1
}
```

## 2. Using `for` as Final Expression

`for` is a statement that returns `null`. Use `each` for transformations.

```nu
# Bad — returns nothing
def squares []: nothing -> list<int> {
    for x in [1 2 3 4] { $x ** 2 }
}

# Good — returns the list
def squares []: nothing -> list<int> {
    [1 2 3 4] | each {|x| $x ** 2 }
}
```

## 3. Mutable Variables for Accumulation

When mutation is genuinely needed, declare it with `mut`; `let mut` is invalid
Nushell syntax. Type annotations follow the binding name.

```nu
# Bad — Rust-style declaration does not parse
let mut errors: list<string> = []

# Correct declaration syntax
mut errors: list<string> = []
```

```nu
# Bad — imperative accumulation
mut total = 0
for item in $items { $total += $item.price }

# Good — math sum
$items | get price | math sum

# Bad — building a list with mutation
mut result = []
for f in (ls) {
    if ($f.size > 1mb) { $result = ($result | append $f.name) }
}

# Good — filter pipeline
ls | where size > 1mb | get name
```

## 4. Dynamic `source`/`use` Paths

Nushell parses all code before evaluation. `source`/`use` require parse-time constant paths.

```nu
# Bad — let is evaluated at runtime
let my_path = '~/scripts'
source $'($my_path)/utils.nu'    # Error!

# Good — use const for parse-time resolution
const my_path = '~/scripts'
source $'($my_path)/utils.nu'
```

## 5. Bash-Style Redirection

```nu
# Bad — > is the comparison operator in Nushell
'hello' > file.txt       # This is a boolean comparison, not redirection!

# Good — use save command
'hello' | save file.txt
'hello' | save --append file.txt
```

## 6. String Parsing External Commands

```nu
# Bad — parsing ls output as strings
^ls -la | lines | each {|l| $l | split column ' ' }

# Good — use Nushell's structured ls
ls -la

# Bad — parsing JSON from curl
^curl -s https://api.example.com | from json

# Good — supported structured responses are parsed according to Content-Type
http get https://api.example.com
```

## 7. Ignoring Type Annotations

```nu
# Bad — untyped, hard to catch errors
def process [data] { $data | get name }

# Good — typed, catches misuse at parse time
def process [data: record<name: string, age: int>]: nothing -> string {
    $data.name
}

# Good — I/O signature
def double []: int -> int { $in * 2 }
```

## 8. Space Before Closure Parameters

```nu
# Bad — space before |params|
ls | each { |f| $f.name }

# Good — no space before |params|
ls | each {|f| $f.name }
```

## 9. Environment Changes in Regular `def`

```nu
# Bad — cd change is lost after command returns
def go-project [] { cd ~/projects/my-app }
go-project
pwd   # Still in original directory!

# Good — use def --env to propagate environment changes
def --env go-project [] { cd ~/projects/my-app }
go-project
pwd   # Now in ~/projects/my-app
```

## 10. Unnecessary String Interpolation

```nu
# Bad — interpolation with no variables
let msg = $"hello world"

# Good — simple string
let msg = 'hello world'

# Bad — double-quoted interpolation without escapes
let greeting = $"Hello, ($name)!"

# Good — single-quoted interpolation (no escapes needed)
let greeting = $'Hello, ($name)!'
```

This preference has one hard exception: a string containing a **literal `(`**
must use `$"..."`. See [#35](#35-using-single-quoted-interpolation-for-strings-with-literal-parentheses).

## 11. Using `each` When `par-each` Works

```nu
# Suboptimal — sequential file processing
ls **/*.json | each {|f| open $f.name | get version }

# Better — parallel processing for I/O bound work
ls **/*.json | par-each {|f| open $f.name | get version }
```

Use `each` only when: order must be preserved, side effects must be sequential, or list is very small.

## 12. Missing Command Documentation

```nu
# Bad — no documentation
def deploy [env, --force] { ... }

# Good — documented command
# Deploy the application to the specified environment
#
# Handles building, testing, and deployment in one step.
@example 'Deploy to staging' { deploy staging }
def deploy [
    env: string     # Target environment (staging, production)
    --force (-f)    # Skip confirmation prompts
] { ... }
```

## 13. Not Using `default` for Optional Values

```nu
# Bad — verbose null check
let name = if $input == null { 'anonymous' } else { $input }

# Good — use default command
let name = $input | default 'anonymous'
```

A negative literal in command-argument position can be parsed as an unknown
flag. Parenthesize it as an expression or terminate flag parsing explicitly:

```nu
# Bad — may be parsed as flag `-1`
$input | default -1

# Good
$input | default (-1)
$input | default -- -1
```

**Gotcha — the default _argument_ is evaluated eagerly**, even when the input is
non-null, because it is an ordinary argument (not a closure). A "fallback" that
can itself error or is expensive runs regardless:

```nu
# Bad — $rec.maybe_missing is evaluated even when $primary is non-null,
# and throws if that column is absent
$primary | default $rec.maybe_missing

# Bad — coalesce-style fallback still throws when the key is missing,
# because default's argument is evaluated before default runs
$delta.reasoning? | default $delta.content      # errors if there is no `content` key

# Good — make the fallback itself null-safe
$delta.reasoning? | default ($delta.content? | default '')

# Good — branch explicitly when the fallback is expensive
if ($primary | is-not-empty) { $primary } else { compute-fallback }
```

## 14. Manual JSON/YAML/TOML Parsing

```nu
# Bad — manual string manipulation
let version = (open Cargo.toml | lines | where $it =~ '^version' | first | split column '=' | get column2.0 | str trim)

# Good — native structured data support
let version = (open Cargo.toml | get package.version)
```

Do not assume a decoded JSON array of objects will describe as `list<record>`.
Homogeneous rows are commonly inferred as `table<...>`, which is still
list-like:

```nu
let rows = ('[{"id":1},{"id":2}]' | from json)
$rows | describe                         # table<id: int>
$rows | describe --detailed | get type  # list
```

For a list-or-table boundary, prefer a typed `list` parameter or the structured
top-level type from `describe --detailed`; a string-prefix test for only `list`
rejects valid tables.

## 15. Not Using `match` for Multi-Branch Logic

Prefer `match` whenever several branches dispatch on the same value. It keeps
the compared value in one place, makes the fallback explicit with `_`, and
avoids drifting conditions in long `if`/`else if` ladders. Keep `if` for one-off
boolean predicates or branches that genuinely compare different expressions.

```nu
# Less clear — chain of if/else
if $status == 'ok' { handle-ok }
else if $status == 'error' { handle-error }
else if $status == 'pending' { handle-pending }
else { handle-unknown }

# Preferred — pattern matching
match $status {
    ok => { handle-ok }
    error => { handle-error }
    pending => { handle-pending }
    _ => { handle-unknown }
}
```

## 16. Incorrect Shebang for stdin Scripts

```nu
# Bad — script won't receive stdin
#!/usr/bin/env nu

# Good — add --stdin flag
#!/usr/bin/env -S nu --stdin
def main [] { $in | process }
```

## 17. Forgetting `export` in Modules

```nu
# Bad — command is private, can't be imported
# my-module.nu
def helper [] { 'hello' }

# Good — export makes it public
export def helper [] { 'hello' }

# Also good — keep internal helpers private intentionally
def internal-helper [] { 'private' }
export def public-cmd [] { internal-helper }
```

## 18. Confusing Pipeline Input with Parameters

```nu
# Bad — treats pipeline data as positional parameter
def my-func [items: list, value: any] {
    $items | append $value
}

# Good — declares pipeline input signature
def my-func [value: any]: list -> list {
    $in | append $value
}

# Usage: [1 2 3] | my-func 4
```

**Why:** Pipeline input is lazily evaluated (streaming); parameters are eagerly loaded. Different calling conventions entirely.

## 19. Using `each` on Single Records

```nu
# Bad — runs only once, not iterating fields!
let rec = {a: 1, b: 2}
$rec | each {|field| print $field }

# Good — iterate key-value pairs
$rec | items {|key, val| print $'($key): ($val)' }
$rec | transpose key val | each {|row| ... }
```

## 20. Accessing Missing Fields Without `?`

```nu
# Bad — error if field doesn't exist
$record.missing_field   # Error!

# Good — use ? for optional access
$record.missing_field?                # Returns null
$record.missing_field? | default 0    # Provide fallback
```

## 21. Not Prefixing External Commands with `^`

```nu
# Ambiguous — could be Nushell builtin or external
find pattern           # This is Nushell's find, NOT Unix find!
sort                   # This is Nushell's sort, NOT Unix sort!

# Clear — explicitly calls external
^find . -name '*.rs'   # Unix find
^sort file.txt         # Unix sort
^grep pattern file     # External grep
```

**Rule:** Nushell builtins always take precedence. Use `^` to unambiguously call external commands.

## 22. Ignoring `complete` for External Command Errors

```nu
# Bad — no error handling for external commands
let output = (^cargo build)

# Good — use complete for full error info
let result = (^cargo build | complete)
if $result.exit_code != 0 {
    print -e $'Build failed:\n($result.stderr)'
}
```

## 23. Empty Collection Checks

```nu
# Bad — comparing length
if ($list | length) == 0 { ... }

# Good — use is-empty / is-not-empty
if ($list | is-empty) { ... }
if ($list | is-not-empty) { ... }
```

## 24. Native Loops or `group-by` on Huge Datasets

Native `each`/`reduce`/`group-by` process data row by row. For very large
datasets this is slow and memory-hungry. Push the work into the `polars`
plugin's columnar dataframes instead.

```nu
# Bad — native group-by + manual aggregation over millions of rows
open huge.csv
| group-by category --to-table
| update items {|g| $g.items.amount | math sum }

# Good — Polars: lazy by default, optimized columnar aggregation
polars open huge.csv
| polars group-by category
| polars agg (polars col amount | polars sum | polars as total)
| polars collect
```

Also remember to **`collect`** a lazy frame — without it you hold a plan, not
results. See [Dataframes](dataframes.md).

## 25. Assuming `parse` Splits Streams into Lines

Since Nushell 0.113, `parse` no longer implicitly splits byte/string streams
from files or external commands into lines. It collects the stream and parses it
as one input value. Add `lines` when you want the old line-by-line behavior.

```nu
# Bad — expects one match per line, but parses the stream as one input value
open app.log | parse -r '^(?<level>\w+) (?<message>.*)$'

# Good — explicit line-by-line parsing
open app.log | lines | parse -r '^(?<level>\w+) (?<message>.*)$'

# Also good — intentionally parse the whole file with a multiline regex
open changelog.txt | parse -r r#'(?ms)^## (?<version>.*?)\n(?<body>.*)'#
```

## 26. Splitting Custom Command Flags Across Lines Without Grouping

A newline can terminate a command invocation. If the next line starts with a
named flag, Nushell may parse it as a separate statement that emits a plain
string or produces a parse error instead of passing the flag to the command.

```nu
# Bad — flags start new statements
build-report $target
--format json
--strict

# Good — short calls stay on one line
build-report $target --format json --strict

# Good — explicit multiline invocation
let report = (
    build-report $target
        --format json
        --strict
)
```

Use the same pattern when reviewing scripts generated from Bash-style wrapped
commands: either keep named flags on the command line or group the whole call.

## 27. Expecting Single-Quoted External Format Strings to Interpret Backslash Escapes

Single-quoted Nushell strings do not process backslash escapes. Double-quoted
strings do, but `\\t` means "literal backslash followed by t". Prefer one
backslash in double quotes for simple escapes so Nushell passes a real tab or
newline. Use `char tab` / `char nl` when the string also needs Nushell
interpolation.

```nu
# Bad — single quotes pass literal "\t"
^git log --format='%H\t%an'

# Bad — double backslash also passes literal "\t"
^git log --format="%H\\t%an"

# Preferred — simple and Nushell passes an actual tab
^git log --format="%H\t%an"

# Good — explicit separator, useful with interpolation
let tab = (char tab)
^git log --format=$'%H($tab)%an'

# Good — use real line delimiters when that makes parsing simpler
let nl = (char nl)
^some-tool --format=$'name=%n($nl)email=%e'
| lines
| parse '{key}={value}'
```

## 28. Using Deprecated Case Conversion Commands

Nu 0.114 deprecates `str upcase` and `str downcase`.

```nu
# Bad — deprecated
$name | str upcase
$name | str downcase

# Good
$name | str uppercase
$name | str lowercase
```

## 29. Depending on Implicit Submodule Imports

Nu 0.114 no longer imports exported submodules implicitly when the parent module
is imported.

```nu
# Bad — callers expect `use foo` to expose `foo sub cmd` implicitly
export module sub {
    export def cmd [] { 'ok' }
}

# Good — re-export the intended submodule surface
export module sub {
    export def cmd [] { 'ok' }
}
export use sub
```

Use `export use sub *` only when flattening submodule commands into the parent
namespace is the public API you want.

## 30. Treating Optional Parameters as Non-Null

Optional positional parameters and typed named options without defaults are
`oneof<T, nothing>` in Nu 0.114+. Boolean switch flags such as `--flag` remain
`bool` and default to `false`. Handle `null` before arithmetic, string
operations, or assignment to a non-null annotated variable.

```nu
# Bad — $count can be null
def repeat [count?: int] {
    0..<$count
}

# Good — provide a default
def repeat [count?: int = 0] {
    0..<$count
}

# Also good — branch explicitly
def repeat [count?: int] {
    let count = ($count | default 0)
    0..<$count
}
```

## 31. Hand-Rolling Semantic Version Logic

Lexical string sort and manual splitting are wrong for SemVer (`1.10.0` sorts
before `1.2.0` as a string).

```nu
# Bad
['1.10.0' '1.2.0'] | sort
$version | split row '.' | update 1 {|n| ($n | into int) + 1 }

# Good
['1.10.0' '1.2.0'] | each { into semver } | sort
'1.2.3' | into semver | semver bump minor
'1.2.3' | into semver | $in in ('>=1.0.0' | into semver-range)
```

## 32. Reading Removed Error JSON

Nu 0.114 removed `$err.json` from `catch` records. Use `$err.details` directly.

```nu
# Bad
try { risky-command } catch {|err| $err.json | from json }

# Good
try { risky-command } catch {|err| $err.details }
```

## 33. Using Removed Spreadsheet Header Flags

`from xlsx --header-row` was removed. `from xlsx` and `from ods` return a record
of sheet tables and use explicit header/start controls.

```nu
# Bad
open report.xlsx --raw | from xlsx --header-row 2

# Good — one sheet table from the workbook record
open report.xlsx | get Sheet1

# Good — control headers and starting rows
open report.xlsx --raw | from xlsx --noheaders
open report.xlsx --raw | from xlsx --first-row 0
open report.xlsx --raw | from xlsx --prefer-integers
```

## 34. Asserting Raw Rendered Nushell Diagnostics

Diagnostics captured from a nested `nu` process are formatted according to the
caller's terminal width. Nu may insert `|` gutters and line breaks inside a
message, so a direct `assert str contains $result.stderr 'expected message'`
can fail only in narrower terminals.

```nu
# Bad — depends on PTY width and ANSI rendering
assert str contains $result.stderr 'OpenSSL key generation failed'

# Good — normalize actual and expected presentation text
def diagnostic-text [value: any]: nothing -> string {
    $value
    | into string
    | ansi strip
    | str replace --all --regex r#'[\s|]+'# ''
}

(
    assert str contains
        (diagnostic-text $result.stderr)
        (diagnostic-text 'OpenSSL key generation failed')
)
```

Prefer direct `try/catch` and `$err.details` when the test does not need a real
subprocess boundary. When it does, use a long, specific phrase and verify once
under a narrow PTY.

## 35. Using Single-Quoted Interpolation for Strings With Literal Parentheses

`$'...'` does no escape processing, so every `(` inside it opens an
interpolation expression — and `\(` cannot escape it. A literal paren is only
expressible in `$"..."`, written `\(`. This is the most frequently repeated
Nushell string mistake, and two of its three failure modes are silent.

```nu
let count = 3

# Bad — silently evaluated, no error: yields "2 items"
$'(1 + 1) items'

# Bad — `env` is a real command, so its whole output (secrets included)
# is spliced into the message
$'Usage: deploy (env) --force'

# Bad — runtime error: `s` is neither a built-in nor an external command
$'Done ($count) file(s)'

# Good — `\(` is a literal paren and `($count)` still interpolates
$"Done ($count) file\(s)"           # => "Done 3 file(s)"
$"Usage: deploy \(env) --force"     # => "Usage: deploy (env) --force"
$"\(1 + 1) items"                   # => "(1 + 1) items"
$"[docs]\(https://example.com)"     # => "[docs](https://example.com)"
```

Only `(` needs escaping; a `)` outside an expression is already literal. Keep
`$'...'` for the common case with no literal parens — especially when the string
contains literal backslashes, which `$"..."` would force you to double.

See [String Formats](string-formats.md) for the parser rule and the full
decision table.
