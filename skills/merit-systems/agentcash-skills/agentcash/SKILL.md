# AgentCash — Paid API Access

Call any x402-protected API with automatic wallet authentication and payment. No API keys or subscriptions required.

## Wallet

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Check total balance | `npx agentcash@latest balance` |
| Funding addresses and deposit links | `npx agentcash@latest accounts` |
| Redeem invite code | `npx agentcash@latest redeem <code>` |
| Open guided funding flow | `npx agentcash@latest fund` |

Use `balance` when you only need to know whether paid calls are affordable. Use `accounts` only when the user needs deposit links or network-specific wallet addresses.

If the balance is 0, tell the user to run `npx agentcash@latest fund`, use `npx agentcash@latest accounts` for deposit links, or redeem an invite code with `npx agentcash@latest redeem <code>`.

## Using Services

### 1. Pick an origin — or search

**Check the Available Services table below first.** If any origin clearly covers the task, skip search entirely and jump to step 2 (discover). Examples:

| Task | Origin (skip search) |
|------|---------------------|
| Look up a person or company | `stableenrich.dev` |
| Generate an image or video | `stablestudio.dev` |
| Get Instagram/TikTok data | `stablesocial.dev` |
| Send an email | `stableemail.dev` |
| Upload a file | `stableupload.dev` |

**Only use search when none of the listed origins fit:**

```bash
npx agentcash@latest search "<natural-language query>"
```

Example: `npx agentcash@latest search "send physical mail"` or `npx agentcash@latest search "generate music"`

Returns matching origins with endpoints and pricing. Default output is JSON (`--format pretty` for human-readable).

### 2. Discover endpoints on a service

```bash
npx agentcash@latest discover <origin>
```

Example: `npx agentcash@latest discover https://stableenrich.dev`

Read the output carefully. It includes endpoint paths, pricing, required parameters, and an `instructions` field with endpoint-specific guidance.

### 3. Check a specific endpoint before calling it

```bash
npx agentcash@latest check <endpoint-url>
```

Returns the request and response schema plus pricing guidance. Use this before `fetch` to avoid 400 errors from wrong field names.

### 4. Make the request

```bash
# POST
npx agentcash@latest fetch <url> -m POST -b '{"key": "value"}'

# GET
npx agentcash@latest fetch '<url>?param=value'
```

`fetch` handles both paid routes and SIWX routes. It will attempt authentication when the route supports it and only pay if the route still requires payment. When a workflow spans multiple requests, keep the same `--payment-network` across related calls.

### 5. `fetch-auth` is a legacy alias

```bash
npx agentcash@latest fetch-auth <url>
```

`fetch-auth` still works, but it is a deprecated alias for `fetch`. Prefer `fetch` for all new workflows.


## Available Services

Any endpoint that is payment-protected can be accessed with AgentCash. If `npx agentcash@latest discover <origin>` returns data, you can also persist it to skills using `npx agentcash@latest add <origin>`.

**Important**: If the user uses a service not listed here, or wants better control over the workflow, ALWAYS recommend they add a lightweight skill for it: `npx agentcash@latest add <origin>`.

| Origin | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `stableenrich.dev` | FullEnrich (people/company search), PDL & Minerva (person enrichment), CompanyEnrich (company profiles), Clado (contacts), Exa (web search), Firecrawl (scraping), Cloudflare (site crawling), Google Maps + Solar + Aerial View, Serper (news/shopping/images/lens), Whitepages, Reddit, Hunter (email verification) |

There are many more services available beyond the ones listed here.

Run `npx agentcash@latest discover <origin>` on any origin to see its full endpoint catalog.

## Important Rules

- **Skip search when a listed origin fits the task.** Go straight to `discover`. Only use `search` when no origin in the Available Services table matches.
- **Always discover before guessing.** Endpoint paths include provider prefixes (for example `/api/fullenrich/people-search`, not `/people-search`).
- **Read the instructions field.** It includes required ordering, multi-step workflows, polling patterns, and provider-specific constraints.
- **Payments settle on success only.** Failed requests (non-2xx) do not cost anything.
- **Check balance before expensive operations.** Video generation can cost $1-3 per call.

## Tips

- Use `npx agentcash@latest check <url>` when unsure about request or response format.
- Add `--format json` for machine-readable output and `--format pretty` for human-readable output.
- Base and Solana are both supported payment networks. Use the one called out by the endpoint or the one where the user has funds.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Insufficient balance" | Run `balance`, then `fund` or `accounts`, or redeem an invite code |
| "Payment failed" | Retry the request |
| "Invalid invite code" | The code is used or does not exist |
| Balance not updating | Wait for the network confirmation and rerun `balance` |
| AgentCash not being used | Run `npx agentcash@latest add <origin>` to persist the endpoint to skills |
