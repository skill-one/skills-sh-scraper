# Theme schema

Use UTF-8 JSON in `theme.json`.

## Managed storage contract

- Editable source: `~/.codexthemes/themes/<theme-id>/`
- Shareable package: `~/.codexthemes/exports/<theme-id>.codex-theme`
- Runtime state: `~/.codexthemes/state/`

These are mandatory defaults, not examples. A user may explicitly request a custom source or export directory. Never default to the current repository, workspace, Downloads folder, or the installed Skill directory. `CODEX_THEMES_HOME` may override the root for automation and tests; do not set it during normal creation unless the user asks for a custom managed root.

```

Omit `art` for `palette-only`. Paths must be relative and remain inside the theme directory. Increment `version` after every visible change.

`preview` names a raster image (PNG, JPEG, or WebP) that shows the **themed workspace** — sidebar, header, and home content together — never the raw background artwork. It becomes the gallery and detail image on codexthemes.ai. When `preview` is omitted, export picks the best raster from `previews/` (files containing `1440` first); keep at least one real workspace capture there.

## Design fields

- `layoutMode`: `native-background`, `native-immersive`, `editorial-showcase`, or `palette-only`.
- `backgroundScope`: `home` or `workspace`.
- `modeReason`: why the reference and concept require light or dark.
- `allowedChanges`: exact surfaces or properties the theme may alter.
- `preserve`: native geometry, components, routes, and states that remain invariant.
- `verificationViewports`: at least one desktop and one narrow viewport.

`workspace` means home plus verified conversation shells. It never means settings or every `main` element.

## Portable package

A `.codex-theme` file is UTF-8 JSON, not a ZIP:

```json
{
  "format": "codex-theme",
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "exportedAt": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "manifest": {},
  "css": "complete CSS source",
  "readme": "theme README",
  "art": {
    "filename": "artwork.png",
    "mimeType": "image/png",
    "base64": "..."
  },
  "preview": {
    "filename": "home-1440x900.png",
    "mimeType": "image/png",
    "base64": "..."
  },
  "verification": {}
}
```

`art` is the theme's background artwork; `preview` is the workspace capture that codexthemes.ai shows in the gallery and on the detail page — the submit API prefers `preview` and only falls back to `art` when no preview is embedded. Normalize CSS to `theme.css` and artwork to a safe basename. Remove absolute paths and private evidence. Reject packages over 30 MB, path traversal, executable content, external CSS resources, scripts, and unsupported asset MIME types.
