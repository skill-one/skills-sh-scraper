## Reading Order

1. **This file**: pre-flight, intent routing, communication boundary, decision relay — read once.
2. **[`task-user-actions-publish.md`](task-user-actions-publish.md)**: on demand — read when the user wants to publish a task.
3. **[`task-user-actions.md`](task-user-actions.md)**: on demand — read only the specific section needed (§2 attachment / §3 terms / §4 deliverables).
4. **[`task-cli-reference.md`](task-cli-reference.md)**: do NOT read full file. Use `grep` for the specific command you need.

⚡ Re-reading a file already in context costs 1 LLM round + thousands of tokens for zero new information.

## User Intent Routing

> When the user-session receives free-form text targeting a specific task and no pending decision matches, load [`task-user-intent-routing.md`](task-user-intent-routing.md) and follow its routing flow.

| Intent | Trigger examples | Route to |
|---|---|---|
| Publish task | "subscribe / subscription task / publish / create a task / use or buy a service from Agent/ASP #XXXX / initiate a direct conversation with this provider" | [`task-user-actions-publish.md`](task-user-actions-publish.md) |
| Add attachment / image | "attach a file/image to a task" | [`task-user-actions.md`](task-user-actions.md) §2 |
| Switch provider / stop task | "switch provider / stop task" | [`task-user-actions.md`](task-user-actions.md) §3 |
| View deliverables | "view / list deliverables" | [`task-user-actions.md`](task-user-actions.md) §4 |
| Designated-provider x402 | "send a request to this endpoint" | [`task-user-actions-publish.md`](task-user-actions-publish.md) §5 |
| Subscription task ops | "auto-renew / trial cancel / reject delivery / apply for refund / claim refund / my subscriptions / subscription charge / subscription cost" | §Subscription below |
| Negotiate with provider | "negotiate with XXX" | Sub session handles automatically |
| Re-submit / nudge | "re-submit / nudge" | [`task-user-intent-routing.md`](task-user-intent-routing.md) |
| Task list / status / close / decision list | "my tasks / view decisions / close task" | [`task-user-intent-routing.md`](task-user-intent-routing.md) |

## Deposit-address QR (insufficient-balance — MANDATORY)

🛑 **Rule:** if `fundingNoticeCommand` exists, run it and follow its output exactly. For `image-notify`, put `markdownImage` under option 1. Never summarize the 4 options/address/gas/resume.

## Subscription

### Subscription-specific field rules

| Field | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `serviceId` | from `task-service-select` response | auto-filled |
| `useTrial` | `subscriptionInfo.supportTrial == true` from `task-service-select` → auto `true`; otherwise `false`. Display hours from `subscriptionInfo.freeTrial` field | **auto-filled, do NOT ask user** |
| `autoRenew` | ask user explicitly before form — no default | 0=off, 1=on |
| Automatic signal execution | Defaults to `auto`. Inspect the ASP description only to learn which supported settings to ask about; persist mode/amount/cap/quote/environment/margin mode/order policy only from the user's reply. An explicit opt-out becomes `manual`. Amount and cap are optional positive decimals, quote defaults to `USDT`, Trade Kit environment is `live`/`demo`, margin mode is `cross`/`isolated`, and order policy is `market`/`signal_price_limit`. Ask missing fields in one natural-language question without choices. Never render execution mode, per-signal amount, per-signal cap, margin mode, or order policy as confirmation-form rows; the existing Trade Kit environment row is the only display exception. None of these values belongs in `serviceParams`. | **local execution configuration; not an ASP business parameter** |
| Signal preflight | Retain schema-v2 `autoTradePreflight` as advisory information. A non-ready or authorization-not-checked Trade Kit produces one optional two-choice preparation card: install/configure Trade Kit, or Later and continue subscribing. On prepare, load `okx-cex-auth` directly when already installed. Only when unavailable, scope the required security scan to `okx/agent-skills`, install it after a passing scan, and load `okx-cex-auth`. Delegate all CLI/OAuth/API-key setup to that skill and re-run readiness afterward. Never auto-install or block subscription creation; other tool reminders remain concise notices. | **optional preparation; not a subscription input** |
| `serviceTokenAmount` | from `task-service-select` response `subscriptionInfo.feeAmount` | must match the selected subscription fee |

Read `autoTradeConfigured` from the JSON success envelope. When it is `true`, no additional execution-
consent question is needed. When it is `false`, the subscription itself still succeeded but local execution
configuration was not persisted: report the local failure without opening a decision card.

For a `next-action` route, its returned confirmation form is the sole field authority; never merge fields
from a Skill appendix or other card into it. Use `task-user-actions-publish.md` **Appendix A2** only for a
direct/fallback subscription route that did not receive a CLI-provided confirmation form.

### Post-creation: Offline-deliverables question

AFTER `create-subscribe` succeeds, render the English block below verbatim or translate it faithfully per §Localization. `{jobTitle}` is the **just-created REAL subscription title** — never a sample.

**Ordering with the mandatory watch:** render this block, but do **not** pause or wait for the user's choice. Immediately continue to §Post-creation: Watch check below and enter watch. Handle the user's preference only when their reply arrives; the preference question must never delay the initial watch or the `sub_created` event.

**Device-routing copy contract:** after every successful creation, render the single device-routing line in the response template below after the success title and before the offline-deliverables question. The line is informational only: do not ask a device question or wait for a device confirmation.

Continue in the same turn to the existing offline-deliverables block and mandatory watch; never end, pause, or wait because of the device line.

> "{jobTitle}" subscription created ✅
> Messages will go to all logged-in devices. You can change device delivery anytime.
> This task keeps producing deliverables while you are offline. What should happen when you return?
> · Replay Missed Deliverables (default) — deliver them when you return; the background process keeps receiving and processing them
> · Discard Offline Deliverables — drop them while offline so the background process does not consume resources
> 💡 In Codex / Claude Code, replayed messages first reach the background process. To see them here, say "listen to {jobTitle}."

**Old comm-package branch** — read `offlineReplaySupported` from the `create-subscribe` success envelope (the CLI already probed it; **never run `okx-a2a capabilities` yourself**). When `false`, append this English line verbatim or translate it faithfully per §Localization. Keep the question/options + 💡 line byte-identical, with the device-routing line between the success title and question:

> 💡 This communication package does not yet support offline-replay preferences. Your choice is saved and takes effect after upgrading (`{fixCommands}`); until then, all subscription messages are replayed normally.

`{fixCommands}` is rendered from the envelope's `offlineReplayFixCommands`, one command per line. When `offlineReplaySupported` is `true` (or the field is absent), add nothing — the question block stays exactly as above.

Branching on the user's reply:
- **No choice, or explicit replay / keep** → do **NOT** write; server default `0` already means replay.
- **Discard** → run `onchainos agent subscribe-offline-update --job-id <this subscription's jobId> --flag 1`, then branch on its `offlineReplaySupported`:
  - `true` (or absent) → "Offline deliverables will be discarded, not replayed."
  - `false` → "Preference saved: offline deliverables will be discarded after the communication package is upgraded; until then, they will still be replayed."
- **Write failure** → do **NOT** roll back or retry creation. Say the setting was not saved, remains at the replay default, and can be changed later. This is a notice, not an error.

### Post-creation: Watch check (mandatory)

This order is fixed: the offline-deliverables question has just been rendered without waiting; now inspect the CLI output and start watch. Never await the preference reply before this check.

After `create-subscribe` succeeds, check the CLI output for a `[Watch]` block:
- `[Watch]` block present → read `skills/okx-ai/references/watch-core.md` and enter its Watch generation. A returned notification, deliverable, or empty poll does **not** end the turn; dispatch the complete batch and re-enter the same scoped command until `watch-core.md` says to stop or a `decision_request` requires the user's reply.
- No `[Watch]` block → **end this turn immediately**.

🛑 This Watch handoff is the **last non-Watch action in the creation flow** — once entered, `watch-core.md` owns the rest of the turn, including every required dispatch and re-entry. Do not run unrelated creation commands after the handoff, and do not confuse "last creation action" with permission to stop after the first watch result. On the `sub_created` event the agent only sends the subscription notification and starts the watch — it does NOT re-scan the description for DApp names, does NOT auto-install any plugin, and does NOT pre-select a tool. Tool install/config is surfaced up-front (before subscribing) as the non-blocking schema-v2 `autoTradePreflight`; the visible install/config flow runs only if the user explicitly chooses an action. A fresh Trade Kit probe also runs on every delivery that actually resolves to Trade Kit. A failed delivery remains visible and execution-blocked; restoring readiness never auto-replays it, while future deliveries continue normally.

### Subscription management (user-initiated)

| Intent | Command | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Subscription detail | `subscribe-detail {subId} --format json` | show subscription detail; **always pass `--format json`** when you render or consume fields (the default text output is a human glance: it shows raw `offline` / `devices` but not `thisDeviceReceives` or joined names) |
| Enable auto-renew | `start-autorenew {subId}` | on-chain, needs EIP-712 sign; may require approve |
| Cancel subscription (trial cancel / close auto-renew) | `subscribe-cancel {subId}` | unified: trial → cancel auto-conversion, no charge incurred, Closed; active → close auto-renew, current period continues to expiry |
| Apply for refund (`refund` / `apply for refund` / `reject delivery` / `dispute` / `request evaluation` / `arbitration`) | `reject {id} --reason "..."` | **unified command** — auto-detects subscription vs regular task. Any matching intent → **always use `reject`** first |
| Claim refund after timeout | `claim-auto-refund {id}` | 🛑 **NEVER use as first step** — only after `reject` AND ASP misses 1-day response window |
| Active subscription cost | `subscribe-cost` | total monthly cost of active formal subscriptions (no params needed) |
| Pause / stop auto copy-trading | `autotrade-consent-set --job-id <jobId> --mode pause` | Direct local action; follow §Pause auto copy-trade below. Do **not** load `task-user-sub-playbook.md`, query subscription state, or resolve an agent id. |
| Start receiving on this device | `subscribe-device-update --job-id <id> --device-list <fresh list + this device>` | **fresh-read first** (`subscribe-detail <id> --format json` or `my-subscriptions`). If `deviceList:null`, default-all is active: report already receiving and do **NOT** write. For an explicit array, do not write if this device is present; otherwise union, write, re-read, and mark `✅ Yes (added now)`. |
| Start receiving on named device(s) | `subscribe-device-update --job-id <id> --device-list <fresh list ∪ named device ids>` | **fresh-read first**; resolve device name→id via `device-list` and never fabricate. If `deviceList:null`, all logged-in devices already receive: report no change and do **NOT** write. Otherwise union with the fresh list, overwrite, re-read, then say: "Okay, Y will now be sent to X1 and X2." List the **complete post-write receiver set** using readable names; join two with `and`, or three or more with commas and `and` before the last. |
| Stop pushing to a device | `subscribe-device-update --job-id <id> --device-list <explicit receiver set − device>` | Resolve device name→id. Subtract from an explicit fresh `deviceList`. For `null`, fetch the complete `device-list`, then materialize all logged-in ids minus the target; if unavailable, stop because a safe update is impossible. Never turn `null` into `[]` or a partial list. Re-read after writing: non-empty → "Stopped sending Y to X. This task now goes only to Z." (use a count if names are unavailable; never invent them); empty → "Stopped sending Y to X. No device now receives this subscription." |
| Change offline-deliverables handling later (`replay missed deliverables` / `discard offline deliverables`) | `subscribe-offline-update --job-id <id> --flag <0\|1>` (`0`=replay, `1`=discard) | **fresh-read first**; if `offlineReceiveFlag` already matches, report no change and do **NOT** write. Otherwise write, then re-read. After `--flag 1`, use the same `offlineReplaySupported` confirmations as above. `--flag 0` keeps its current behavior. |
| List devices | `device-list` | render §Device List; `lastOnlineLocal` is already CLI-derived |
| Receive, start, verify, or resume subscription signals | — | Route to §Signal-receipt watch entry below. Resolve exactly one ACTIVE buyer subscription, ensure this device receives without dropping other devices, then enter sticky scoped watch. Never guess a historical jobId or fall back to global watch. |
| Listen with no task specified | — | confirm exactly one task ("Only one task can be watched at a time") → enable this-device receipt → enter `watch-core.md` through its existing-subscription scoped-watch authorization gate → say new messages will appear live here |

For other subscription-management actions, if the user does not specify a `subId`, use
`subscribe-detail` to check the subscription or ask the user to provide it. Exact signal-receipt phrases
instead follow the dedicated resolution flow below; do not apply this generic fallback to them.

### Signal-receipt watch entry

Treat `receive signals` / `start receiving signals` / `are you receiving signals` /
`resume watching subscribed services` / `continue receiving signals` / `resume subscription` /
`restore subscription`, plus semantically equivalent wording in any language, as a current-turn receipt +
watch action. The prompted `listen to <subscription title>` form is also actionable when the title resolves
from the just-created or just-rendered buyer-subscription context. When current focus is an ACTIVE buyer
subscription, this includes a bare restore/resume request
even if it omits “signals” or “watch”; it must not enter generic watch or drain historical signals first.
Treat an interrogative form as read-only only when the same message asks why/how/basis or explicitly asks
about device configuration rather than starting conversation watch.
In a compound request, any stop in steps 1–3 ends only this receipt branch; continue each independently
authorized lifecycle/progress action unless the user explicitly made it conditional on receipt success.

1. **Resolve exactly one ACTIVE buyer subscription.** A title/jobId named in the current message wins.
   Otherwise use one unambiguous current focus established by a fresh list/detail, the subscription
   notification being replied to, or the active scoped-watch exchange. Historical recency alone never
   establishes focus. For an exact bare action in a new session with no current focus, run
   `onchainos agent my-subscriptions --role buyer` and keep only `statusName == "ACTIVE"` candidates:
   exactly one proceeds; multiple require the user to choose; zero stops with a clear explanation.
   Never guess a historical jobId or fall back to global watch.
2. **Fresh-read receipt state.** Run `subscribe-detail <jobId> --format json`. If the fresh subscription
   is no longer `ACTIVE`, explain that it cannot produce a new business signal and stop without watch.
3. **Ensure this device receives without dropping any other receiver.**
   - `thisDeviceReceives == true` → no write; preserve `deviceList:null` when present.
   - `thisDeviceReceives == false` with `deviceList:null` → inconsistent routing data; explain and
     stop without a write or watch.
   - `thisDeviceReceives == false` with an explicit array → resolve this device id, build the UNION
     of the fresh array and this device, run `subscribe-device-update`, then re-read detail. Missing
     device id, malformed data, write failure, or failed read-back stops without watch.
   Immediately before watch, the latest detail MUST report `thisDeviceReceives == true`.
4. **Enter sticky scoped watch through the authorization gate.** Load `watch-core.md` and run its
   §Existing-subscription scoped-watch authorization gate before the banner or any watch call. Only after
   the gate passes, emit the canonical banner and run
   `okx-a2a user watch --json --job-id <jobId>`. Keep the jobId sticky for every re-entry. Never substitute
   global watch or claim that starting watch proves a new signal already exists.

### Restore execution-configuration reply

When the immediately preceding assistant turn asked for missing restore configuration after
`autotrade-watch-precheck`, bind the reply only through the exact local `continuationId` returned in that
turn. Run `autotrade-consent-continue --job-id <sameJobId> --agent-id <sameAgentId>
--continuation-id <exactId>` with only `--trade-amount`, `--cap`, `--quote`, `--environment`,
`--margin-mode`, or `--order-policy` values explicitly authored
in this reply. If the user explicitly disables automatic execution, add `--mode manual`; if they affirm
the displayed automatic default, add `--mode auto`. Supplying the mode on resume records the user's
confirmation; never treat the continuation's default `auto` value as confirmation. Never infer a value or
authorization from ASP prose.

If `validationErrors` or `missingFields` remains, ask once for only those fields in natural language and
end the turn. If complete, run the exact returned `consentCommand`, then resume the same subscription at
§Signal-receipt watch entry step 2 so receipt state and the canonical authorization gate are fresh-read
before watch. Never show A/B/C options or create a delivery-time authorization decision. A generic amount
or currency message without the preceding bound prompt is not sufficient authority to update consent.

### Pause auto copy-trade

This is a latency-sensitive local authorization toggle owned by the user session. Clear automatic
execution authorization for **that one subscription** so a later actionable signal requests execution
configuration again:

```bash
onchainos agent autotrade-consent-set --job-id <jobId> --mode pause
```

- Resolve `jobId` from the specific copy-trade notification the user is replying to. If the request is
  bare and more than one subscription is auto-following, ask which subscription; never guess.
- Do not query subscription detail, resolve an agent id, load `task-user-sub-playbook.md`, or interrupt
  the business flow with an extra confirmation. Scope remains this `jobId` only.
- Success returns the existing `consentMode:"pause"`, `cleared:true`, and `jobId` fields. Tell the user
  that automatic execution is paused while the subscription and signal receipt remain active.
- Pausing automatic execution does not cancel the subscription or disable signal receipt.

**Device-routing safety flows (must be encoded as copy/behavior):**
- **Tri-state contract (never collapse):** `deviceList:null` or a missing field = historical/unconfigured routing, so **all logged-in buyer devices receive by default**; `deviceList:[]` = the buyer explicitly selected no receiving device; a non-empty array = only those device ids receive. The CLI's `thisDeviceReceives` already applies this contract for the buyer view. Never use truthiness or `unwrap_or_default`-style reasoning that makes `null` and `[]` equivalent.
- **Clear-list confirmation:** if removal would empty the list, warn "No device will receive this subscription" and confirm before writing.
- **Overwrite from fresh read:** the new `--device-list` is ALWAYS built from the just-re-read state (`subscribe-detail <id> --format json` / `my-subscriptions`), never from conversational memory — `subscribe-device-update` overwrites wholesale, so a list read short by even one id silently stops that device from receiving. A fresh `null` is a routing mode, not an empty base list: enabling any device is a no-op; disabling one requires materializing the complete `device-list` first.
- **Neutral copy:** promise only "messages for this subscription task"; make no promise about system-notification scope.

### Reject + refund flow (detailed)

> **Intent mapping**: "refund" / "apply for refund" / "reject delivery" / "dispute" / "evaluation" / "request evaluation" / "arbitration" → `reject` (Step 1 below).
> The `reject` command is unified — it auto-detects subscription vs regular task by `jobType`.
> 🛑 `claim-auto-refund` is NOT the entry point — NEVER call it directly for a refund intent. It is only used in Step 3 after ASP timeout.
<!-- retention: Keep arbitration-family action aliases for input recognition. Route them directly to reject without a legacy-role rename prompt; these are task actions, not the Evaluator role. -->

When the user is unhappy with a delivery (subscription or regular task):

```
Step 1 — Reject (on-chain, user initiates)
  onchainos agent reject {id} --reason "quality not met"
  → auto-detects: subscription → /subscribe/{id}/reject; regular → pre-reject/reject dual-sign
  → status = Rejected
  → ASP has 1 day to respond

Step 2 — ASP responds (one of three outcomes)
  A. ASP agrees to refund → sub_asp_agree event → status = Failed (funds returned)
  B. ASP files dispute   → sub_asp_dispute event → status = Disputed (awaiting DM evaluation)
  C. ASP does not respond within 1 day
     → user may claim refund manually:

Step 3 — Claim refund (only after ASP timeout)
  onchainos agent claim-auto-refund {subId}
  → status = Failed (funds returned)
```

Key rules:
- `reject` requires `--reason` (max 2000 chars); for subscriptions, one rejection allowed per subscription.
- `claim-auto-refund` is only valid when status = Rejected AND the ASP response window has passed.
- If the ASP files a dispute, the user must wait for the Dispute Manager's ruling (follows the existing on-chain dispute resolution flow).

## My Subscriptions (buyer view)

Trigger: `my subscriptions` / `subscription list` / `what am I subscribed to`. Routing entry: [`task-user-intent-routing.md`](task-user-intent-routing.md).

Command: `onchainos agent my-subscriptions --role buyer` → JSON `{ "list": [ … ], "thisDeviceId": <String|null>, "thisDeviceName": <String|null> }`; also run `onchainos agent device-list` for the complete logged-in device table. Render exactly **one row per subscription**. **Render every column below—never drop Provider or Billing Period, and keep Next Charge as one derived date, not a period range. Then append one column per real device.**

Immediately above the table, render this localized legend:

> ✅ Receives task messages; ❌ Does not receive task messages

The device columns below are illustrative — replace them with the user's **actual readable device names**, never aliases such as D1 / D2:

| # | Service | Provider | Status | Fee | Next Charge | Auto-Renew | Billing Period | Chen Baijia’s MacBook Pro (This Device) | Kevin’s MacBook Pro |
|---|------|--------|------|------|---------|---------|------|------|------|
| 1 | {title} | Agent#{providerAgentId} | {statusName} | {serviceTokenAmount} | {nextCharge} | {autoRenew==1?"✓":"✗"} | {billingPeriod} | {deviceCell} | {deviceCell} |

- **Status**: render CLI `statusName` verbatim (`ACTIVE / REJECTED / DISPUTED / COMPLETED / CLOSED / FAILED / INIT / UNKNOWN_<n>`). Billing Period distinguishes trial from paid (`trialType==1` → `Trial Period`).
- **Fee**: render the `serviceTokenAmount` string verbatim; never convert it to float. The CLI provides only `serviceTokenAddress`, not a token symbol.
- **Billing Period**: `trialType==1` → `Trial Period`; else positive integer `periodIndex` → `Billing Period {periodIndex}`; else null/non-positive → `—`.
- **Next Charge** (derive; no CLI field): `statusName != "ACTIVE"` → `—`; else `trialType==1` → prefer `trialEndTime`, fall back to legacy `trailEndTime` (AC-17), render as the trial-conversion charge date, or `Date Unavailable` if both are absent; else `autoRenew==1` → `subEndTime`; `autoRenew==0` → `No Renewal`. Render epoch seconds as a date.
- **Dynamic device-column matrix:** build columns once. Put `thisDeviceId` first and append `(This Device)` to its readable name; keep others in `device-list` order. Keep one row per subscription. Do **not** add routing summaries, repeat rows, or replace names with D1/D2 aliases. A wide table is acceptable.
- **Device names and disambiguation:** use readable `deviceName`; escape Markdown separators/line breaks. For duplicate names, append a short device-id suffix to each; retain `(This Device)` where applicable. If a non-empty `deviceList` references an id absent from an otherwise usable device table, append `Device Name Unavailable ({short deviceId})`. Never fabricate a name.
- **Per-cell receipt state (status gate, then tri-state):** When `statusName != "ACTIVE"`, render every device cell as `-`, including the current-device and degraded-render cells. For `ACTIVE` rows, `deviceList:null` means default-all, so every device cell is `✅`; `deviceList:[]` means explicitly none, so every device cell is `❌`; a non-empty array uses id membership (`✅` when present, otherwise `❌`). Apply the same tri-state rule to appended unknown-id columns. The **ACTIVE this-device cell always comes directly from the CLI `thisDeviceReceives` flag** — never recompute it. The legend above the table defines the symbols; do not repeat the full explanation inside every cell.
- **Degraded render (MANDATORY — device table unavailable):** keep one row per subscription and one dynamic column for the known current device: `{thisDeviceName} (This Device)`, with its cell following the per-cell receipt-state rule above. Above the table, add "Other device names and receipt states are unavailable." If `thisDeviceName` is absent, use `Device Name Unavailable ({short thisDeviceId})`; never fabricate a name or use bare `(This Device)`.
- **Display-only rule:** on any list render, do **not** proactively ask whether to turn on receipt (product retracted that prompt); turning on happens only on explicit user request.
- All timestamps are **epoch seconds** — render as the user's locale date, never raw numbers.
- Empty list → "You have no subscriptions." Do NOT invent rows.
- To open one row's detail, pass its **`jobId`** to `subscribe-detail` (§Subscription Detail).

## Post-login subscription display (login-flow-triggered)

**Trigger (entry layer):** a newly completed wallet login, not a standalone OKX.AI free-text intent and not `wallet status`. [`wallet.md`](../../okx-agentic-wallet/references/wallet.md) owns the single entry point: step 3 after a successful login poll. Do **NOT** add trigger words to `SKILL.md` for this display.

**Programmatic data source (mandatory).** A successful `wallet login --phase poll` may return the already-aggregated snapshot at `data.postLoginSubscriptions`: `subscriptions` is the exact buyer `my-subscriptions` payload; `devices` is the complete `device-list` payload (or `null` on device-query failure). `wallet status` never returns this field. Consume the poll snapshot directly. **Never issue a follow-up `my-subscriptions` or `device-list` command in the login flow.** User-initiated §My Subscriptions remains a separate command flow.

**New-device default routing (login only).** After resolving a non-empty User `agenticId` and before the login heartbeat, the CLI checks whether this device already exists in the complete device table, then always sends the heartbeat regardless of whether that optional probe succeeded. A device proved new gets production/pre-release-isolated durable state, is registered, then is added to every subscription's explicit `deviceList` by fresh-list union and batched overwrite (≤100 items per request); `deviceList:null` remains null because it already means default-all. Progress is persisted after each confirmed batch and the state becomes `completed` before rendering, so retries touch only unfinished jobs and cleanup failure cannot re-enable a later manual opt-out. The CLI returns `postLoginSubscriptions` only after routing succeeds, so the table never appears before the new device is configured. An already-registered device without pending work is never rewritten on re-login. If `agenticId` is unavailable or the pre-heartbeat probe fails, the heartbeat still registers/refreshes the device, but automatic routing and the table are safely suppressed.

**Zero-disturb (mandatory).** The CLI omits `data.postLoginSubscriptions` when the subscription lookup errors (no OKX.AI identity, transport/auth failure), times out, or returns an empty list. When absent, output **nothing** OKX.AI-related — no table, no opening line, no 💡 hint, no error, no mention that a check ran. The login flow concludes normally. Never surface the attempt.

**Non-empty render.** Reuse §My Subscriptions **as-is**: the same one-row-per-subscription dynamic device-column matrix, actual device names, device ordering and disambiguation, tri-state cell mapping, `thisDeviceReceives` authority, legend, and mandatory degraded render when `device-list` fails/empty. Only the surrounding copy below differs.

- **Surrounding copy.** Precede the legend and table with this English line verbatim or translate it faithfully per §Localization:

  > Here are your subscriptions and each device's message-receipt state. You can change device delivery anytime.

  Follow the table with exactly **one** 💡 hint: Codex / Claude Code messages do not appear automatically; the user must say `listen to <task title>`. Use a **real** title from this render, never a sample:

  > 💡 In Codex / Claude Code, task messages do not appear automatically. To see them here, say "listen to {a real subscribed title from this render}."

### Post-login executable-subscription profile restore

For every ACTIVE executable subscription received by this device, the CLI restores the bounded execution
profile but never creates or changes local consent. It does not emit
`autoTradeAuthorizationPrechecks`, ask for authorization, or render a decision card during login. Existing
`auto`/`manual` policy is preserved; missing policy is configured only when the user explicitly restores
that subscription's watch, and an unreadable policy remains a blocking local error.

The old receipt/listening rule remains unchanged: during login, do **not** ask
whether to turn on receipt or start listening — enabling happens only when the user explicitly asks later.

## Subscription Detail

Trigger: select a row / `subscription detail` / `show this subscription`. Command: `onchainos agent subscribe-detail <jobId> --format json`; the positional id is the row's **`jobId`** (the response primary key; no separate `subId`) → one `SubscriptionInfo`. **`--format json` is mandatory when consuming fields**: default text lacks `thisDeviceReceives` and joined device names. Render:

> **{title}** — {statusName}
>
> Subscriber: Agent#{buyerAgentId}
> Provider: Agent#{providerAgentId}
> Trial: {trialType==1 ? "Yes" : "No"}
> Fee: {serviceTokenAmount} (token {serviceTokenAddress[0:6]}…) / period
> Auto-Renew: {autoRenew==1 ? "On" : "Off"}
> Billing Period: {periodIndex}
> Offline Deliverables: {offlineReceiveFlag==1 ? "Discard" : "Replay (Default)"}

- Amount fields (`serviceTokenAmount` / `paymentTokenAmount` / `paymentCurrencyAmount`) are **strings**; render verbatim, never as floats.
- The CLI provides only `serviceTokenAddress`, not a token symbol; show a short address.
- Offline Deliverables = detail response `offlineReceiveFlag`: `1` → `Discard`; `0` or absent → `Replay (Default)`. This field exists only in subscription detail; tolerate absence everywhere and never error on it.

After the card, append a **two-column device table**; do not repeat subscription fields. Use one row per device. Prefix the current-device row with 🌟 and append `(This Device)` (e.g. `🌟xxxxxxx (iPhone 15) (This Device)`). The 🌟 prefix is exclusive to §Subscription Detail.

| Logged-in Device | Receives Task Messages |
|---|---|
| {🌟 if this device}{deviceName}{(This Device) if this device} | {✅ Yes / ❌ No from `thisDeviceReceives` / membership} |

- **Logged-in Device** names come from joining an explicit `deviceList` with `device-list`. For `deviceList:null`, use every logged-in buyer device because routing is default-all. **Fall back to a raw id/count when names are unavailable; never fabricate one.**
- **Receives Task Messages**: `deviceList:null` → every buyer device is `✅ Yes`; explicit array → membership. The current-device row always uses CLI `thisDeviceReceives` directly.
- Subscribe time fields render as Unix **seconds** (device-list times are ms — different unit).
- **Degraded fallback:** when the device table is unavailable, show two rows: the known current device and `Other device receipt states unavailable`. Never present one device as the full set.

## Device List

Trigger: `device list` / `list my logged-in devices` / `which devices are online`. Command: `onchainos agent device-list` → JSON `{ "list": [ … ], "total", "thisDeviceId" }` (CLI paginates to completion; render the full set). Render **three columns—no Online column** because the CLI emits no `online` field:

| Device | Last Online | Received Subscription Messages |
|---|---|---|
| {deviceName}{(This Device) if `isThisDevice`} | {lastOnlineLocal} | {derived — see below} |

- **Device**: readable `deviceName`; if empty, show raw `deviceId` / a count, never fabricate. Append `(This Device)` when `isThisDevice==true`.
- **Last Online**: render `lastOnlineLocal` **verbatim**; never re-convert or parse `lastOnlineTime`.
- **Received Subscription Messages**: join each `deviceId` with subscription `deviceList` from `my-subscriptions`. `null` matches every logged-in buyer device; `[]` matches none; non-empty uses membership. List subscriptions received, or show Yes/No for a specific subscription.
- Empty list (`list: []`) → tell the user no devices are currently listable. If the command errors (endpoint not live yet / transport), see the degraded render in §My Subscriptions / §Subscription Detail — state that device info is temporarily unavailable rather than presenting a partial picture as complete.

## Create-subscribe device routing

This section applies only to signal subscriptions created with `create-subscribe`; do not apply it to ordinary `create-task`.

Creation always defaults to all logged-in devices. Do **not** run `onchainos agent device-list` before `create-subscribe`, do not show a device table, and do not branch on device count or device names.

Create-time device selection or exclusion is unsupported. If the user asks to choose, include, or exclude devices during creation, explain that a successful subscription starts on all logged-in devices and that they can adjust receiving devices after creation. Do not translate the request into CLI flags and do not silently claim that it was applied.

After creation, explicit user requests to view or change receiving devices continue to use §Device List and §Subscription management with fresh reads before updates.
