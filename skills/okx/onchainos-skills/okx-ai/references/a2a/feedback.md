# Completion Feedback

Use this helper only when a completion payload has `rating.required=true`.

## User rates ASP

Read `rating.deliverables` and `rating.taskAttachments`, compare them with the
task description and parameters, then generate a score from 0.00 to 5.00 and a
comment of at most 100 characters.

```text
onchainos agent feedback-submit \
  --agent-id <rating.targetAgentId> \
  --creator-id <rating.creatorAgentId> \
  --score <score> --task-id <jobId> --description "<comment>"
```

## ASP rates User

Use requirements clarity, response timeliness, and collaboration: 5 excellent,
4 good, 3 acceptable, 2 vague/slow, 1 problematic, 0 abusive or non-responsive.
Submit with the same command and payload identifiers.

## Subscription User rates ASP

Use `rating.providerAgentId` as the target and `rating.creatorAgentId` as the
creator. Keep the same score and comment limits.

Do not submit a rating when `required=false`. Preserve the exact score and
comment for the result notification; a failed or hash-less submission is not a
successful rating and must not be announced as one.

This helper owns AI-generated completion feedback only. A later human-authored
rating follows the receiving role's rating leaf and replaces that role's AI
rating for the same `jobId`. AI completion feedback must not overwrite an
existing rating.
