# One-Time Task Creation

Enter only from `create-prepare.md` with the latest bound Service payload.
`decision=ready` does not authorize creation. Subscription Services route to
`subscription-create.md` instead.

## Collect inputs

If `payload.serviceGuide` is non-blank, complete and independently confirm
`create-guide.md` first. Then parse only `payload.serviceDescription` for
explicit required and optional inputs. Ignore promotional text and never invent
scope.

Fill values from the User's request or direct answers. Ask for all missing
required values together; re-ask only missing or invalid values. Produce:

- `title`: concise, at most 30 characters;
- `Description`: requested outcome plus confirmed inputs, 20–2000 characters;
- `serviceParams`: only confirmed inputs required by the Service description;
- attachments: each explicit local file, retained for repeated `--file` flags.

If supplementary files are implied but absent, ask once whether to add them now
or after creation. Do not show a second standalone parameter confirmation.

## Final confirmation

scene: One-time job creation confirmation

display template:

```markdown
### One-time Job Creation Confirmation

- Job Name: {title}
- Job Description: {Description}
- Service Provider: Agent {providerAgentId}({providerAgentName})
- Fee: {feeAmount} {feeTokenSymbol}
- Service Parameters: {serviceParams}

To create this job, reply “Confirm”.
```

display rules:

1. Preserve the confirmed Job Name, Job Description, and Service Parameters.
2. Render the Service Provider as `Agent {providerAgentId}({providerAgentName})` when the name is available, or `Agent {providerAgentId}` otherwise.
3. Render a zero Fee as `Free`; otherwise render the exact amount and token symbol.
4. Render the Service Parameters item for confirmed parameters.
5. Render attachments below the field list.
6. Keep Guide Consent in its separate confirmation.
7. `Confirm` is the explicit final confirmation for only the current complete card. Apply edits and render the whole confirmation again.
8. Keep the confirmation vertical: render exactly one field per bullet line and
   never combine fields into a horizontal table or inline prose.
9. Guide only the `Confirm` action. Do not add a `Cancel` action or cancellation
   instruction to the confirmation copy.

## Communication check

After confirmation, run once:

```bash
onchainos agent communication-check
```

`data.ok=true` without a note continues silently. Otherwise show the returned
hint/note and ask the User to choose Repair communication or Continue creation.
Repair uses `../../shared/chat-comm-init.md`. Reuse the confirmed task parameters;
do not repeat this check or the confirmation afterward.

## Create once

Use `payload.serviceId` for `--service-id`; `sid` is never the Service UUID.

```bash
onchainos agent create-task \
  --title <title> \
  --description <confirmed-description> \
  --provider-agent-id <payload.providerAgentId> \
  --payment-token-symbol <payload.feeTokenSymbol> \
  --payment-token-amount <payload.feeAmount> \
  --service-id <payload.serviceId> \
  --service-params '<confirmed JSON or {}>' \
  --service-token-address <payload.feeToken> \
  --service-token-amount <payload.feeAmount> \
  [--file <attachment> ...] \
  [--service-guide '<exact serviceGuide>' \
   [--service-guide-hash '<exact serviceGuideHash>'] \
   --guide-consent-json '<confirmed Consent JSON>']
```

Include the complete Guide bundle only for a non-blank Guide. Pass confirmed
Service context unchanged; do not repeat price, balance, or provider checks.
On `broadcast_submitted/watch_task`, hand the complete structured result
unchanged to [`../../runtime/watch.md`](../../runtime/watch.md). This leaf owns
the creation command through receipt of that result; Runtime Watch owns the
post-result sequence: initial one-time progress, watch banner, creation-start
note, then the scoped watch call. Creation is final only after `job_created`.
For an uncertain mutation result, query fresh task state before considering any
retry.
