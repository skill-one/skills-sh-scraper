# Provider Delivery

Use this leaf only after fresh detail proves a one-time task is Accepted, or a
subscription is Active within its delivery period. Execute the registered
Service workflow first; do not replace it with an ad-hoc implementation.

```bash
onchainos agent deliver <jobId> --agent-id <aspAgentId> \
  [--file <path> | --deliverable-text <text>]
```

The CLI owns the complete delivery sequence:

1. upload a native file or long text when necessary;
2. send the `[intent:deliver]` A2A message;
3. stop if the A2A send fails;
4. submit and broadcast a one-time task only after that send succeeds;
5. persist the local deliverable.

Do not separately upload, send, submit, or save the same deliverable. Do not
use retired `--message` or `--autotrade` flags. An uncertain write result is
reconciled from fresh task state and is never blindly retried.

After success, wait for `job_completed` or `job_rejected`. A provider-side
`job_submitted` event is display-only: notify once and never resend delivery.
