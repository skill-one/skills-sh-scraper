# Nuxt Audit Ownership

Nuxt solution configs are generated artifacts. Use their compiler output as audit
evidence, but do not edit them or run a generator implicitly.

| Generated config | Nuxt configuration owner |
| --- | --- |
| `.nuxt/tsconfig.app.json` | `typescript.tsConfig` |
| `.nuxt/tsconfig.node.json` | `typescript.nodeTsConfig` |
| `.nuxt/tsconfig.shared.json` | `typescript.sharedTsConfig` |
| `.nuxt/tsconfig.server.json` | `nitro.typescript.tsConfig` |

When `.nuxt` is absent, report `NUXT_GENERATED_CONFIGS_MISSING`. Ask the user to run
the project’s documented prepare command and rerun the audit. The skill must not run
prepare itself: generation can execute project hooks and change the working tree.

When some generated configs exist and others do not, the state is
`NUXT_GENERATED_CONFIG_PARTIAL`, not a missing `.nuxt`: prepare has already run and this
Nuxt version simply does not generate every program. Audit the programs that exist, name
the absent ones as an explicit coverage gap, and do not ask for another prepare run.

A `*_LOCAL_COMPILER_UNAVAILABLE` diagnostic in a project without a `.git` directory
(an unpacked archive, a vendored copy) usually means the compiler is hoisted above the
inspected directory: the lookup only walks up inside a repository, so rerun with `--root`
at the workspace root instead of the package directory.

For an audit, inspect each existing generated program with its local checker: `vue-tsc`
for app and `tsc` for server, shared, and node. Compare only normalized repo-owned
paths internally. Report per-program effective flags and covered/uncovered counts for
production, tests, and config files; do not expose raw compiler output or file lists.
If any local compiler is unavailable or exits nonzero, retain every reported program identity
and their safe effective flags, report a stable diagnostic, and leave aggregate coverage
unavailable. Partial compiler output is not evidence for exact coverage.
