# Claude Code Issue Workflow

Create an issue in `anthropics/claude-code`. Every `gh` command must use that repository; never infer it from the
working directory.

## Live Form Workflow

1. Fetch authenticated repository/template context with
   `<skill-dir>/scripts/yeet-context.sh repo anthropics/claude-code --issue-templates`. Resolve `<skill-dir>` to the
   absolute directory containing the owning `SKILL.md`.
2. Select the live YAML form matching the user's intent: bug, feature request, documentation, or model behavior. Ask
   only when that semantic choice is genuinely ambiguous.
3. Run `<skill-dir>/scripts/issue-form.py inspect --repo anthropics/claude-code --template <selected.yml>` and compose
   answers keyed by the returned field IDs. Do not compare SHAs or consult a static template mirror.
4. Gather only environment facts requested by the live form. `claude --version` supplies the Claude Code version.
   Normalize OS and terminal values to exact live dropdown options; place precise versions in a free-text field when
   useful. Infer Anthropic API, Bedrock, or Vertex only from environment/user evidence.
5. Mark a required checkbox true only when its attestation is verified. Render through
   `<skill-dir>/scripts/issue-form.py render`; resolve every reported missing/invalid answer before posting.
6. Run `posting.md > External-disclosure Review` on the agent-authored answers and rendered body. Compose a concise
   title after the live prefix. Use live template labels/type only when cached permission allows them.
7. Post with `gh issue create --repo anthropics/claude-code --title ... --body-file ...`, adding permitted labels and
   issue type from rendered metadata. On label permission failure, run the posting idempotency check, then retry once
   without labels. If rendered metadata includes `projects`, apply each entry after creation with
   `posting.md > Project-Template Metadata`; a project-add failure is partial completion and never an issue-recreation
   trigger.

The helper owns form parsing and exact body structure. The agent owns template selection, environment interpretation,
answer/title writing, the external-disclosure review, and posting. Follow `posting.md > Error Handling and Idempotency`
after any ambiguous result; never recreate a possible partial issue.

For a comment on an existing issue, use `posting.md > Comment on Existing Issue` with this fixed repository. Finish a
successful creation with the verified URL and the `### 🚀 Issue created` receipt.
