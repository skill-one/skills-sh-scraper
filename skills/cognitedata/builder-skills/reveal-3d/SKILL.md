# Reveal 3D Viewer

Add a Cognite Reveal 3D viewer to a Flows app using the published `@cognite/reveal-widget` npm package. Renders CAD models, point clouds, 360° image collections, and CDF scenes from CDF, with model browsing or direct model/revision IDs.

DM instance to visualize: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Use This When

The user wants to embed an interactive Cognite Reveal viewer for CDF 3D content in a Flows app.

Do **not** use this skill for static diagrams, graph visualizations, or unrelated custom Three.js scenes.

Do **not** use the deprecated app-local "copy the bundle" approach — that pattern (a `src/features/reveal-3d/` folder of copied provider/hook source) is replaced by installing `@cognite/reveal-widget` directly. If an app still has a copied bundle from a prior integration, migrate it to this package rather than extending it.

## Prerequisites

- The app uses React + TypeScript and is wrapped in `@cognite/app-sdk`'s `CogniteSdkProvider` (Flows auth), which supplies the `CogniteClient` (`sdk`) via `useCogniteSdk()` from `@cognite/app-sdk/react`. `@cognite/dune` is the CLI used to scaffold/deploy the app, not the runtime auth library — apps created with `npx @cognite/dune apps create` depend on `@cognite/app-sdk` for this, not `@cognite/dune` itself (the `useDune()`/`@cognite/dune/auth` hook only exists for legacy `--classic` scaffolds).
- The CDF project has 3D models, or the user has supplied direct model/revision IDs or a CDM (`externalId`/`space`) model reference.
- For DM-linked 3D, the instance/model must be identifiable via a CDM `externalId`/`space` pair or a classic `modelId`/`revisionId`; instance highlighting works once a model is loaded and the instance is contextualized (mapped) to it.
- Determine whether the project's 3D content lives in the **Core Data Model** or the classic 3D API before setting `viewerOptions.useCoreDm` — don't default it to `true`. There's no single flag for this; [csp-and-fixes.md](references/csp-and-fixes.md) gives the exact SDK calls to check directly.

## Integration Workflow

Follow these steps in order. Adapt paths to the target app's conventions instead of inventing new ones.

1. **Inspect the target app.** Read `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `src/main.tsx`, and the app's folder/alias conventions.
2. **Install the package and peers** with the app's package manager. See [Dependencies](#dependencies). Reuse existing pinned React and SDK versions where they satisfy the peer ranges.
3. **Configure Vite.** Read [vite-config.md](references/vite-config.md) and add the `three`/`@cognite/reveal` dedupe entry. No process/util/assert polyfills are needed — the package ships browser-ready.
4. **Configure `manifest.json`'s CSP allowances** for whatever the scene/model actually contains (scene ground-plane/skybox textures, 360° image collections). Read [csp-and-fixes.md](references/csp-and-fixes.md) — it also covers the app-side fix point clouds need (`manifest.json` can't grant it directly) and a StrictMode gotcha, so read it even if the app has no scenes/360 content yet.
5. **Add a controller class** that wraps `RevealWidgetController` and drives it imperatively (load resources, style/highlight instances, control the camera) from your own event handlers — not from `useEffect` reacting to prop changes. See [implementation.md](references/implementation.md).
6. **Mount `RevealWidget`** with `viewerOptions={{ sdk, useCoreDm }}` (set `useCoreDm` per the project, not hardcoded — see [csp-and-fixes.md](references/csp-and-fixes.md)) and `setControllerRef` inside a container with an explicit height. `RevealWidget` manages its own internal Reveal context — do not wrap it in another provider from this package.
7. **Choose the resource pattern.** Use the model-browser pattern (`sdk.models3D.list()` + classic `modelId`/`revisionId`) as the default unless the user has already supplied a CDM `externalId`/`space` model reference. Full examples in [implementation.md](references/implementation.md).
8. **Clean up.** Call `.remove()` on any `Reveal3DResourceHandle` returned by `addResource` when it's no longer needed (selection change, unmount).
9. **Run typecheck and build** (`tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm build`, etc.) and fix any dependency/peer-version issues.

## Minimal Example

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
import type { CogniteClient } from '@cognite/sdk';
import {
  RevealWidget,
  type Reveal3DResourceHandle,
  type RevealWidgetController,
  type ThreeDResourceIdentifier,
} from '@cognite/reveal-widget';

class ThreeDViewerController {
  private model: Reveal3DResourceHandle | undefined;

  constructor(private readonly widgetController: RevealWidgetController) {}

  async loadModel(resource: ThreeDResourceIdentifier): Promise<void> {
    this.model = await this.widgetController.addResource(resource);
    this.widgetController.cameraController.focusModel(this.model);
  }

  dispose(): void {
    this.model?.remove();
  }
}

export function ViewerPage({
  sdk,
  resource,
}: {
  sdk: CogniteClient;
  resource: ThreeDResourceIdentifier;
}) {
  const viewerRef = useRef<ThreeDViewerController>();

  function handleWidgetController(widgetController: RevealWidgetController | undefined) {
    viewerRef.current?.dispose();

    if (widgetController === undefined) {
      viewerRef.current = undefined;
      return;
    }

    const viewer = new ThreeDViewerController(widgetController);
    void viewer.loadModel(resource);
    viewerRef.current = viewer;
  }

  return (
    <div style={{ width: '100%', height: '70vh', position: 'relative' }}>
      <RevealWidget
        viewerOptions={{ sdk, useCoreDm }} // set per the project — see csp-and-fixes.md
        setControllerRef={handleWidgetController}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Dependencies

Suggested versions are starting points. If the target app already pins compatible versions, defer to the app.

| Package | Suggested version | Purpose |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| `@cognite/reveal-widget` | `^0.1.0` | The `RevealWidget` component and its types |
| `react` / `react-dom` | `^18.3.1` (peer) | UI framework — peer dependency, must match the app |
| `@cognite/reveal` | `4.35.3` (peer) | Reveal viewer runtime — peer dependency, exact match required |
| `@cognite/sdk` | `^10.13.0` (peer) | CDF API client — peer dependency |

Everything else (`three`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `@base-ui/react`, `@floating-ui/react`, `@tabler/icons-react`, `dayjs`, `lodash-es`, `ml-matrix`, `random-seed`, `@cognite/aura`) is a transitive dependency of the package and installs automatically — do not add it manually unless the app needs to pin a version, **or unless app code imports from it directly**. The model-browser pattern in [implementation.md](references/implementation.md) does exactly that with `@tanstack/react-query` (`useInfiniteQuery`/`useQuery`) — add it as a direct dependency in that case, since importing from an undeclared transitive dependency breaks under strict package managers like pnpm.

Example install (pnpm; adapt to the app's package manager):

```bash
pnpm add @cognite/reveal-widget @cognite/reveal @cognite/sdk react react-dom
```

After install, check that the app's `@cognite/reveal` and `react`/`react-dom` versions satisfy the package's peer ranges (`@cognite/reveal` requires an exact `4.35.3` match).

Do **not** copy any source bundle into the app and do **not** install `process`, `util`, `assert`, `ajv`, or `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` for this package — none of that is needed.

## Critical Rules

- Drive the widget **imperatively** through `RevealWidgetController`, obtained via `setControllerRef`. Don't try to reconstruct Reveal's old declarative provider tree (`CacheProvider`/`RevealProvider`/`RevealCanvas`/`Reveal3DResources`) — that API belongs to the old copied-bundle approach and is not what this package exposes.
- `RevealWidget` wraps its own Reveal context internally — never nest it inside another provider from this package.
- Dispose the previous controller class instance (`.dispose()` calling `.remove()` on tracked handles) inside `setControllerRef` before constructing a new one, and again when `widgetController` becomes `undefined` (unmount).
- Resources passed to `addResource` must match the exact identifier shape for their `type`/`sourceType` combination (see [implementation.md](references/implementation.md)) — mixing classic and CDM fields is a type error.
- Instance highlighting only affects instances that are already contextualized (mapped) to a loaded model; load the model first, then call `styleByInstance`/`focusInstances`.
- `RevealWidget`'s container must have an explicit height — it fills its parent.
- Lazy-load canvas-heavy viewer content with `React.lazy` + `Suspense` when adding a route/page.
- `useCoreDm` must match the project, not default to `true` — wrong 401s and silent 360-collection failures otherwise. Don't wrap the app in `React.StrictMode` — it tears down `RevealWidget`'s viewer mid-load in dev and produces errors that don't occur in production. Point clouds need an app-side same-origin fix, since `manifest.json` can't grant the `data:` CSP allowance they'd otherwise need. All three: see [csp-and-fixes.md](references/csp-and-fixes.md).

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] `@cognite/reveal-widget` is installed alongside its peers (`react`, `react-dom`, `@cognite/reveal`, `@cognite/sdk`) at compatible versions.
- [ ] No source bundle was copied into the app; all imports come from `@cognite/reveal-widget`.
- [ ] `vite.config.ts` includes `resolve.dedupe: ['three', '@cognite/reveal']` (plus the app's existing dedupe entries).
- [ ] No `process`/`util`/`assert` polyfills or `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` were added for this package.
- [ ] `RevealWidget` is mounted once, is not nested in another Reveal provider, and its container has an explicit height.
- [ ] `viewerOptions.useCoreDm` matches whether the target project is actually Core-Data-Model-based.
- [ ] The app does not wrap itself in `React.StrictMode`.
- [ ] `manifest.json` grants `img-src` for `https://*.cognitedata.com` if the app loads scenes with ground planes/skybox, and `connect-src` for the actual signed-URL host observed from a CSP violation if it loads 360° image collections. If the app needs point cloud support, the same-origin `Blob`-patch fix has been applied and verified.
- [ ] A controller class wraps `RevealWidgetController`, obtained via `setControllerRef`, and drives `addResource`/`styleByInstance`/`focusInstances`/`cameraController` imperatively.
- [ ] The controller class is disposed (and tracked resource handles `.remove()`d) both when a new controller is set and on unmount (`widgetController === undefined`).
- [ ] Resource identifiers use the correct `type`/`sourceType` shape for the model being loaded.
- [ ] Typecheck and build pass.
