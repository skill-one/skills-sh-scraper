# Tone of Voice Reference

Load this file when starting a training report. Apply the guidance throughout the entire document — cover, body, individual feedback, and recommendations all follow the same register.

## By audience

### Executive / Direction

Goal: give them a clear picture in 30 seconds. They skim.

- Lead with outcomes and conclusions, not process
- State problems plainly — "the session was cut short" not "the session experienced some time management challenges"
- Recommendations must be concrete and actionable: budget, timeline, owner
- No jargon, no acronyms without expansion, no internal vocabulary
- Omit anything that doesn't affect a decision

### HR / Learning & Development

Goal: assess training effectiveness and plan follow-up.

- Behavior and evolution are central — show change over time, not just snapshots
- Individual feedback must be specific and useful, not just positive
- Tie observations to learning objectives stated at the start
- Frame problems as development opportunities where genuine — but do not soften real blockers into "areas for growth" if they require direct intervention
- Attendance, engagement, and completion rates matter — include them if relevant

### Direct management (team lead, department head)

Goal: know what their team learned and what to do next week.

- Practical and operational — what changes on Monday?
- Name participants directly in feedback (they know their team)
- Recommendations must be immediately actionable: "block 30 minutes per day for practice" is better than "encourage regular practice"
- Flag any individual who needs extra support or follow-up coaching

### Client (external)

Goal: justify the value of the training and set expectations for follow-up.

- Professional, measured, and constructive
- Avoid internal vocabulary — write as if they have no context about the team dynamics
- Problems and blockers should be named but always paired with a recommendation
- Diplomatic on individual feedback — clients don't always need names; you can write "some participants" or "a minority of the group" when appropriate
- The report reflects on your professional reputation — review every sentence

### Internal archive

Goal: complete record for future reference.

- Comprehensive over concise — include details that might seem obvious now
- Factual tone, no optimization for any particular reader
- Include session structure, materials used, timing, and participant list if available
- Note anything that would need to change if the session were run again

## By language

### French

**Register:** formal by default. Use `vous` in any direct address. Full sentences, no contractions in prose. Avoid familiarities even in individual feedback.

**Sentence structure:** French formal writing drifts toward the passive and toward long subordinate clauses. Push back:

- Prefer `X a fait` over `X a été réalisé`
- Split sentences at 30 words — French readers tolerate longer sentences than English, but formal documents still benefit from rhythm
- Avoid starting consecutive sentences with the same subject

**Typography:**

- Guillemets with non-breaking spaces: `«\u00a0texte\u00a0»`
- Non-breaking space before `:`, `;`, `!`, `?`
- `EUR` in formal financial contexts, non-breaking space between number and unit: `100\u00a0EUR/mois`
- Em dash `—` not double hyphen `--`

**Vocabulary:**

- Avoid anglicisms unless the term has no French equivalent in the field (e.g. "workshop", "feedback", "prompt" are acceptable in tech contexts)
- `formation` not `training`, `participants` not `attendees`, `compte rendu` not `rapport` for this type of document
- Verbs over nominalizations: `mettre en place` not `la mise en place de`

**Common AI tells to eliminate:** `Il convient de noter`, `dans le cadre de`, `à cet égard`, `par ailleurs`, `ainsi`, `en effet` at sentence start, `crucial`, `essentiel`, `notamment`, `permettre de + infinitif` as a sentence opener (→ See `samber/cc-skills@humaniseur-fr` skill for the canonical French AI-tell catalog and removal patterns)

### English

**Register:** depends on client culture. Default to clear and direct. Calibrate British vs. American if it matters for the audience (ask the user in Step 1).

**Sentence structure:**

- Active voice, subject-verb-object, no ambiguity
- One idea per sentence in high-stakes sections (executive summary, individual feedback)
- Contractions are acceptable in informal sections (individual feedback, conversational observations); avoid in executive summary and recommendations

**Typography:**

- Curly quotes: `"..."` and `'...'`
- Em dash: `word—word` without spaces (American) or `word — word` with spaces (British)
- Numerals: spell out one through nine; use figures from 10 upward

**Vocabulary:**

- Avoid Latin abbreviations (i.e., e.g., etc.) in flowing prose — write them out
- Prefer concrete nouns over abstract ones: `the group struggled with X` not `there were challenges around the area of X`
- `participants` not `attendees` or `trainees` in most contexts
- Avoid corporate filler: `leverage`, `synergy`, `learnings`, `takeaways` → rephrase

**Common AI tells to eliminate:** `It is worth noting that`, `it is important to highlight`, `in today's fast-paced world`, `this approach enables`, `moreover`, `furthermore` at sentence start, adjective doublets (`comprehensive and thorough`, `clear and concise`)

### Spanish

**Register:** formal (`usted`) by default unless the user confirms an informal context.

**Sentence structure:**

- Spanish formal writing is naturally richer in subordinate clauses than English or French. Allow for longer sentences but break them at natural pauses to maintain clarity.
- Subject-verb agreement errors are common in AI output — verify every complex sentence.
- Subjunctive is frequently required in recommendations: `se recomienda que el equipo practique` not `se recomienda practicar`

**Typography:**

- Inverted punctuation at sentence start: `¿pregunta?`, `¡exclamación!`
- Guillemets `«\u00a0...\u00a0»` or Spanish quotation marks `"..."` — ask the user which the client uses
- `EUR` or `€` — check client convention

**Vocabulary:**

- Avoid direct loan words from English when a Spanish equivalent exists: `retroalimentación` not `feedback`, `taller` not `workshop` (unless the client uses it)
- Regional differences matter: Latin American Spanish differs from European Spanish in vocabulary and some formality conventions — ask the user which applies

### German

**Register:** formal (`Sie`) by default unless explicitly told otherwise. German formal writing tends to be precise and comprehensive — do not cut technical detail for brevity.

**Sentence structure:**

- Compound sentences and subordinate clauses are natural in German. Keep verb placement correct: `nachdem die Teilnehmer die Aufgabe abgeschlossen hatten, ...`
- Avoid starting too many consecutive sentences the same way.
- Main clause before subordinate clause in recommendations when possible — it reads more directly.

**Typography:**

- Anführungszeichen: `„Zitat"` (lower-left, upper-right)
- Non-breaking space before units: `100\u00a0EUR`

**Vocabulary:**

- Compound nouns are standard — use them rather than translating English phrases literally: `Teilnehmerfeedback` not `Feedback der Teilnehmer`, `Weiterbildungsmaßnahme` not `Maßnahme zur Weiterbildung`
- Anglicisms: "Workshop", "Feedback", "Coaching" are broadly accepted in German professional contexts; avoid less established ones

### Portuguese (European vs. Brazilian)

**Critical first step:** ask the user which variant applies — vocabulary, formality norms, and even punctuation differ significantly.

**European Portuguese:**

- Formal, restrained, indirect register
- Avoid the imperative in recommendations — prefer the infinitive or subjunctive: `recomenda-se que a equipa pratique` not `pratiquem regularmente`
- `equipa` not `equipe`, `utilizador` not `usuário`
- Closer to French in its preference for formal distance

**Brazilian Portuguese:**

- More direct and warmer tone is acceptable even in formal documents
- Imperative in recommendations is natural: `incentive a equipe a praticar`
- `equipe` not `equipa`, `usuário` not `utilizador`
- English loanwords are more freely used in tech and business contexts

**Typography (both variants):**

- Quotation marks: `"..."` or `«\u00a0...\u00a0»` — check client convention
- Non-breaking space before units

## Diplomatic framing for difficult feedback

Individual feedback requires care regardless of language or audience.

**Principle:** describe behavior, not character. Name what happened, not what kind of person the participant is. Let the facts carry the weight. One interpretive sentence at the end is enough.

| Avoid | Prefer |
| --- | --- |
| "X was obstructive" | "X declined to complete the exercise, citing [reason]" |
| "X didn't understand" | "X struggled with [specific concept] and required additional explanation" |
| "X was enthusiastic" | "X completed all exercises before the others and asked follow-up questions on [topic]" |
| "X was resistant" | "X expressed reservations about [specific aspect] throughout the session" |
| "X was disengaged" | "X did not complete [specific step] and left the session early" |

When writing for an external client about a team member you don't know:

- Avoid naming individuals in negative feedback unless the trainer explicitly requests it
- Use group-level language: "a minority of participants", "some participants expressed..."
- Reserve named feedback for clearly positive observations, or for significant blockers that management needs to address directly
