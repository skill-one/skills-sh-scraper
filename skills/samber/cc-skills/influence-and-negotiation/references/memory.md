# Negotiation Memory System

A negotiation rarely closes in one session. Between sessions — switching tools, losing context, resuming days or weeks later — the accumulated intelligence evaporates and you re-explain everything from scratch. The memory system is a structured set of markdown files that persist across sessions and let you resume exactly where you left off.

## The memory system is always flat markdown files

The memory lives in a directory of plain markdown files — `negotiation-{slug}/` — regardless of tool or platform. This is the source of truth. What varies across platforms is only **how those files are read, written, and surfaced between sessions**.

## Naming convention

All memory files share a **slug**: a short, lowercase, hyphenated identifier for the negotiation (e.g. `acme-renewal`, `q3-salary`, `nao-2026`). The directory is always named `negotiation-{slug}/` and the files inside always use short names (`memory.md`, `context.md`, etc.).

## Platform detection — how to access the files

Detect what's available and use the best method for reading and writing the flat files.

| Priority | Access method | Cross-session? | How |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Agent with file write access** (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) | ✅ Yes | Write directly to `negotiation-{slug}/` in the repo or workspace. Read them back at the start of the next session. |
| 2 | **Obsidian MCP** (if available) | ✅ Yes | Write the flat files into the Obsidian vault at `negotiations/negotiation-{slug}/`. Obsidian indexes and links them automatically — the files remain plain markdown, Obsidian is just the viewer. |
| 3 | **Claude (claude.ai) — within a Project** | ⚠️ Partial | Create one Artifact per file (markdown type). Artifacts in a Project persist across conversations. Title each artifact `negotiation-{slug}-{file}` (e.g. `negotiation-acme-renewal-memory`). |
| 4 | **Claude (claude.ai) — no Project / ChatGPT Canvas** | ❌ Per-conversation | Create one Artifact or Canvas per file within the session. **Warn the user at session end**: _"These don't persist across new conversations — copy each file's content and save it locally, or paste them at the start of the next session."_ |
| 5 | **Any other tool** | ❌ Manual | Output the markdown files as text blocks. The user saves them locally and pastes them into context at the next session start. |

**Obsidian as a format layer.** When Obsidian MCP is available, the flat files are written to the vault unchanged. Obsidian adds backlinks, graph view, and search on top — useful for mapping stakeholder relationships across a long negotiation — but the files themselves stay plain markdown. Any agent can read them without Obsidian.

## Default structure

```
negotiation-{slug}/
  memory.md       ← entrypoint: status, index, load order, structure definition — READ THIS FIRST
  context.md      ← situation, parties, mandate (Mandascan)
  stakeholders.md ← org map, influence map, MICE, POS per person
  numbers.md      ← all quantitative data: offers, amounts, volumes, changes over time
  log.md          ← session-by-session append-only event log
  strategy.md     ← decisions made, rationale, next session plan
```

Six files is the default. **The structure may be adapted** — if the negotiation is simple, merge files; if it's complex, add domain-specific files.

Whatever structure is used, it must be declared in `memory.md` under a `## Structure` section so any agent can discover it. Never rely on assumed structure — always read `memory.md` first.

## Taking initiative

Don't wait to be asked. Proactively:

- **Create the memory** at the end of the first substantive session, even if the user didn't ask for it. Announce what you created and where to find it.
- **Update the memory** after any significant event mid-session — a new offer, a stakeholder revealed, a concession, a mindset shift. Don't wait until session end.
- **Flag when something important is missing** — if `numbers.md` has no figures but prices were discussed, say so. If a stakeholder was named but isn't on the map, add them immediately.
- **Propose structure improvements** when the negotiation evolves — if a new workstream opens (e.g. a parallel legal track), suggest adding a file for it and declare it in `memory.md`.
- **Warn proactively** when a Mandascan axis approaches Escalation or Rupture — put a `⚠️ Warning` in `memory.md` even if the user hasn't asked.

## Load policy

At the start of every session, read `memory.md` first — it contains the current status and tells you which other files to load. Never skip it.

| File | Load when |
| --- | --- |
| `memory.md` | **Always, first.** Before Phase 1 intake. |
| `context.md` | Every session — mandate and situation overview. |
| `strategy.md` | Every session — current strategy and next session plan. |
| `numbers.md` | When any offer, amount, or figure is discussed. |
| `stakeholders.md` | When discussing who's involved, motivations, or influence. |
| `log.md` | When the user asks "what happened in the last session" or needs to trace a pattern back. |

## When to create

Create the full directory at the end of the **first substantive session** — after Phase 1 intake at minimum, ideally after Phases 1–3. Don't wait until the negotiation is complete; the value is in continuity across rounds.

## When to update

- **End of every session** — update `log.md`, update `strategy.md` (next session section), update `numbers.md` if any figures moved.
- **After any significant event** — new offer, new stakeholder revealed, deadline introduced, concession made.
- **When the counterparty's mindset shifts** — log it in `stakeholders.md` (mindset shifts section) immediately. Shifts are the most valuable signal and the most easily forgotten.

## Structure

_List every file in use for this negotiation. If the default structure was adapted (files merged, renamed, or added), document it here. Any agent resuming this negotiation must read this section to discover the actual file set._

_Artifact/Canvas title for each file: `negotiation-{slug}-{file}` (e.g. `negotiation-acme-renewal-memory`)._

## Load order this session

2. context.md — mandate check
3. strategy.md — pick up from last session's plan
4. [numbers.md / stakeholders.md / log.md as needed]

## Warnings

_⚠️ Flags that must not be forgotten: mandate approaching Escalation or Rupture, counterparty deadlines, political risks, commitments made that constrain the next move. Update this section immediately when a warning emerges — don't wait._
