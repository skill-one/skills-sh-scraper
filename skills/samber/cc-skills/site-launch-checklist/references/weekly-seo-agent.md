# Weekly SEO maintenance sub-agent

Definition for a scheduled background agent — a subagent or custom agent on any harness (see "Agent definition file" below for the concrete equivalents), such as Hermes or Claude Cowork Routines — that runs weekly post-launch to monitor SEO health and surface action items.

## Setup

1. Copy the agent definition for your harness (see "Agent definition file" below) into the location that harness's block specifies, in the site's repo (or a dedicated ops repo if you manage multiple sites).
2. Confirm the following MCP servers (or equivalent API access) are connected:
   - **Ahrefs MCP** (required, for backlinks and rankings)
   - **PostHog MCP** (required, for traffic correlation)
   - **Google Search Console** (recommended, via community MCP such as `gsc-mcp`; if no MCP, fall back to `curl` with a service account credential file)
   - **Web search** (built-in on most harnesses, for SERP feature checks and competitor monitoring)
3. Confirm the agent has access to the project source code if they apply to the site's content.
4. Schedule weekly execution. Options:
   - Cron running that harness's headless/non-interactive invocation (e.g. `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "/agents weekly-seo"` on Claude Code, `copilot -p "/agent weekly-seo"` on Copilot CLI) — only in a trusted environment
   - The harness's own scheduled/background-agent feature, where one exists (e.g. Claude Cowork, Hermes)
   - GitHub Actions weekly schedule, posting the report to a Slack channel
   - Manual invocation each Monday morning

When MCP servers are not available, fall back to a browser extension or headless browser where the harness supports one, or to direct API calls per the "MCP usage" section in each harness's block below.

## What the agent does

Run all 10 tasks below in one weekly pass. Each task produces a section of the final report.

### 1. Ranking changes (GSC + Ahrefs)

- Pull top 50 queries by impressions for the last 7 days from Google Search Console.
- Compare positions, impressions, clicks, and CTR to the prior 7 days.
- Flag any (page, query) pair that:
  - Dropped more than 5 positions
  - Lost more than 20% impressions
  - Lost more than 30% clicks while position is stable (CTR collapse, often a SERP feature stealing clicks)
- Output: ordered list of (page, query, delta, hypothesis, recommended action).

### 2. Page-2 opportunities (GSC)

- Identify queries ranking positions 11 through 20 with more than 100 impressions in 7 days.
- For the top 5: fetch the current page 1 SERP via `web_search` and compare structure, depth, and recency of the top 3 results to the site's current content.
- Output: content gap analysis with specific edit suggestions (add FAQ section, expand introduction, add benchmark table, etc.).

### 3. New backlinks (Ahrefs MCP)

- Pull new referring domains acquired in the last 7 days.
- Categorize each: high authority (DR > 50), niche relevant (matches site topic), neutral, spam.
- Flag spam links for potential disavow file submission.
- Output: list of new links with category, plus a draft disavow line for any spam.

### 4. Lost backlinks (Ahrefs MCP)

- Pull referring domains lost in the last 7 days.
- For losses from domains with DR > 40 or known niche relevance: draft outreach email asking why and offering to fix any broken links.
- Output: list of lost links plus draft outreach for high-value losses.

### 5. Core Web Vitals drift (GSC + PageSpeed Insights)

- Pull the Core Web Vitals report from GSC (mobile and desktop separately).
- Compare to the prior week.
- Flag any URL group that crossed from "Good" to "Needs improvement" or "Poor".
- For each flagged group: run PageSpeed Insights via `web_fetch` on a representative URL and identify the failing metric (LCP, INP, or CLS) and likely cause.
- Output: list of affected URL patterns with proposed fixes.

### 6. Indexation health (GSC)

- Pull the Page Indexing report.
- Compare "Indexed" and "Not indexed" counts week-over-week.
- For new entries in "Not indexed", group by reason (Discovered not indexed, Crawled not indexed, Excluded by noindex, Soft 404, etc.).
- Output: per-reason summary with recommended fix.

### 7. AI bot traffic (PostHog MCP)

- Query PostHog for sessions where the user agent matches `(GPTBot|ClaudeBot|PerplexityBot|Google-Extended|anthropic-ai|ChatGPT-User|CCBot|Bytespider|Amazonbot)`.
- Compare counts to the prior week, broken down by bot.
- If the site type is `doc-site` and counts are growing: positive signal, surface as a metric.
- If the site type is `marketing/lead-gen` or `paid-course` and any AI bot has nonzero traffic: verify `robots.txt` is actually blocking by fetching `https://example.com/robots.txt` and grepping for the bot. If it should block but isn't, this is a blocker.
- Output: per-bot weekly count with delta, plus blockers if any bot is reaching pages it should not.

### 8. Competitor SERP monitoring

- For the top 5 target keywords (configured per site in a YAML or JSON file the agent reads): capture the current top 3 SERP results via `web_search`.
- Compare to the prior week's snapshot (the agent should persist last week's snapshot).
- Flag new entrants in the top 3 (potential threat) and dropped competitors (potential opportunity).
- Output: per-keyword SERP delta with strategic note.

### 9. Content freshness audit

- List pages older than 6 months (use Git log on the content files, or GSC "Last crawled" date) with declining clicks over the trailing 4 weeks.
- For the top 5 by lost clicks: recommend a refresh priority based on remaining traffic, topic stability, and competitor SERP activity.
- Output: refresh queue with effort estimate.

### 10. Schema and structured data validity

- Sample 5 pages at random plus the homepage.
- For each, extract the JSON-LD via `curl -s URL | grep -A 200 'application/ld+json'`.
- Validate against schema.org by checking required properties for the declared `@type` (the agent has a local rules file or fetches schema.org definitions).
- Output: list of breakages with file path and fix.

### 11. Stats memory snapshot

At the end of every run, append a row to `weekly-seo/memory/stats.csv` (create if missing):

```
date,indexed_pages,clicks_7d,impressions_7d,avg_position,new_backlinks,lost_backlinks,lcp_ms,cls,inp_ms,ai_bot_sessions
```

This builds a longitudinal record the agent can query in future runs for trend analysis (e.g., 4-week rolling average, detecting regressions that don't show up in week-over-week deltas).

Also append to `weekly-seo/memory/keywords.csv` (one row per target keyword per run):

```
date,keyword,position,impressions,clicks,ctr,page_url
```

These two files are the agent's persistent memory. Never truncate or overwrite them. Always append.

### 12. Change log (what worked)

Read `weekly-seo/memory/changelog.md` (create if missing). This file is a running log of **changes applied to the site** and their measured impact.

**On every run:**

1. For each entry in the changelog with `status: pending-validation` and a `measure_after` date that has now passed: pull the relevant metric (rankings, clicks, CWV, etc.) for the affected page or keyword and compare to the baseline recorded at change time. Update the entry with `status: validated` or `status: no-effect`, the measured delta, and a one-sentence conclusion.
2. At the end of the report, emit a **"What worked" section** listing only `validated` entries with positive delta, ordered by impact. This is the institutional memory of SEO wins.

**When instructed to log a change** (user or orchestrator passes a change description):

Append to `weekly-seo/memory/changelog.md`:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>

- **Page/scope**: `https://example.com/page` (or "site-wide")
- **Change**: one-sentence description of what was done
- **Hypothesis**: why this should improve the metric
- **Baseline**: clicks=N, position=N, LCP=Nms (snapshot at time of change)
- **Metric to watch**: clicks | position | LCP | CLS | INP | backlinks
- **Measure after**: YYYY-MM-DD (typically 3–4 weeks out)
- **Status**: pending-validation
```

Never delete changelog entries. `no-effect` entries are as valuable as wins — they prevent re-testing the same hypothesis.

## Output format

The agent produces a single Markdown report saved to `weekly-seo/YYYY-MM-DD.md` and (optionally) posted to Slack.

Report structure:

```markdown
# Weekly SEO Report: example.com (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Summary

- Indexed pages: N (delta vs last week)
- Total clicks (7d): N (delta)
- Total impressions (7d): N (delta)
- New backlinks: N | Lost: N
- AI bot sessions: N (delta)

## Agent definition file

Same 12 tasks, same `weekly-seo/config.yml`, same memory files, same fallback behavior on every harness below — only the agent-definition schema and file path change. Pick the block matching your harness; none of them is the "real" one. This skill is not exhaustive on harness internals; verify field names against each harness's current docs before relying on them in production.

Reads and web access run unattended (`permission = "always"`); writing files and running shell commands ask for confirmation each time (`permission = "ask"`), since those are the two actions this agent could get wrong destructively. If you want fully unattended weekly runs (e.g. scheduled via cron, matching the Claude Code "Cron" option in Setup), raise `write_file` and `run_shell_command` to `"always"` yourself — that's a deliberate trust decision for the operator to make, not a default this doc should set.

Windsurf, Cursor, and Codex CLI don't have a confirmed, documented custom scheduled-agent-file schema at the time of writing — for those, take the same structure shown above (name, description, tool list, system prompt covering Configuration/Tasks/MCP usage/Output/Tone) and adapt it to whatever custom agent or automation mechanism the harness exposes, then verify against its current docs.

## Config file template

Place at `weekly-seo/config.yml` in the site's repo.

```yaml
domain: example.com
gsc_property: sc-domain:example.com
ahrefs_project_id: 12345
posthog_project_id: 67890
slack_webhook: https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
target_keywords:
  - "keyword one"
  - "keyword two"
  - "keyword three"
  - "keyword four"
  - "keyword five"
site_type: doc-site # or marketing, saas-app, paid-course, portfolio
```

The agent reads this config to scope every task. If the file is missing, the agent asks the user if invoked interactively, or fails with a clear error if invoked headlessly.
