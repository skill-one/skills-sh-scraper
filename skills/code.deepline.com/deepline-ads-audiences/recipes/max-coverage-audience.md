# Max Coverage Paid Ads Audience

Use this recipe when the user asks for maximum B2B paid-audience coverage, highest match rate, or to keep increasing coverage. The output is still paid ads audience upload data, not outbound contact data.

This recipe extends the default cost-effective pass. It should not skip validation, account discovery, consent checks, or holdouts.

## Success Metric

Optimize for incremental matched audience coverage, not raw enrichment coverage.

Primary metric:

```text
cost per incremental matched person =
  Deepline spend / additional matched people versus baseline
```

Report these values for every coverage layer:

- attempted rows
- row hits
- unique contacts with at least one uploadable hash
- unique hashes added
- remaining no-personal-hash contacts
- Deepline spend
- estimated incremental matched people after platform readback
- cost per incremental matched person after platform readback

## Required Preflight

Before enrichment spend:

1. Confirm the list can be used for paid ads audience creation.
2. Confirm enriched identifiers can be used for paid ads matching.
3. Confirm geography. Default to US-only for personal-identifier enrichment unless the user confirms broader rights.
4. Discover uploadable ad accounts and show `Account Name (Account ID)`.
5. Confirm platform credentials can create, sync, and read back audiences.
6. Create a holdout/control group before enrichment.
7. Set a budget cap for fallback beyond Aviato/LimaData.

Do not proceed to paid fallback if the ad account cannot be discovered or validated. Fix the activation path first, otherwise enrichment spend may create a list that cannot be uploaded.

## Coverage Ladder

Run the ladder in this order, but do not stop personal-email hash enrichment just because a contact already has a work email. Work-email hashes are the baseline and holdout; personal email hashes are additive identifiers that should be collected for as many eligible contacts as possible.

Use these scopes:

- Baseline scope: all rows with first-party uploadable identifiers.
- Personal-hash scope: all eligible rows with enough identity context for the provider, including rows that already have work-email hashes.
- Provider-dedup scope: for a given paid provider, skip only rows that already have a usable personal email hash from an earlier personal-hash provider, unless the user explicitly asks to test overlap.
- Expanded fallback scope: rows still missing a personal email hash after Aviato/LimaData, not rows missing any uploadable identifier.

### L0: Source And Baseline

Build a baseline object from first-party identifiers:

- work email normalized and SHA-256 hashed once
- phone SHA-256 only if already present and permitted
- first name, last name, country, postal code where supported
- LinkedIn URL, company domain, company name, title for lineage and QA

Upload baseline separately. This is the denominator for lift.

### L1: Existing Hashes And Warehouse Edges

Use any existing paid-ads-safe hashes already present in the source system or warehouse.

Validation:

- accept only lowercase 64-character SHA-256 hex hashes;
- reject placeholders and malformed hashes;
- do not hash a provided hash again;
- record source columns used.

### L2: LinkedIn Repair

For rows missing verified LinkedIn profile URLs, run the LinkedIn URL lookup ladder before LinkedIn-dependent hash providers. Include rows that already have work emails; LinkedIn repair is meant to unlock personal-hash providers and improve match coverage beyond the work-email baseline.

Use cleaned account/company aliases and validate identity before merging:

```text
"{{full_name}}" ("{{account_name}}" OR "{{linkedin_company_name}}") site:linkedin.com/in -inurl:dir -inurl:pub
"{{full_name}}" "{{title}}" "{{linkedin_company_name}}" site:linkedin.com/in -inurl:dir -inurl:pub
"{{full_name}}" "{{account_name}}" site:linkedin.com/in -inurl:dir -inurl:pub
```

Accept a candidate only when:

- URL is `linkedin.com/in/`;
- first and last name match, allowing common nicknames;
- company/title evidence supports the match;
- ambiguous results are profile-scraped and revalidated before merge.

Do not spend heavily on LinkedIn repair when coverage is already high. Report attempted rows and recovered verified URLs.

### L3: Cost-Effective Hash Providers

Run Aviato and LimaData before broader fallback.

Use provider hashes as-is when they are valid SHA-256:

- Aviato hash provider on all eligible rows with LinkedIn/profile context, including rows that already have work-email hashes.
- LimaData audience identifier hashes on rows still missing a personal hash after Aviato, or as first provider when that is more cost-effective for the available inputs.

Extract hashes only from explicit hash fields such as:

- `matched_result`
- `result.data.hashedEmails[]`
- `result.data.hashed_email`
- `result.data.hashed_emails[].normalized_hash`
- `hash`
- `sha256`

Never upload a JSON object string as a hash value.

#### ContactOut hashed identifiers (batch, pool-level)

`contactout_get_hashed_email_identifiers` converts LinkedIn profile URLs
directly into hashed email identifiers. It runs beside this ladder rather than
as a step in it, because it cannot waterfall: the response is an unattributed
pool, so it can neither skip rows an earlier provider covered nor let a later
provider skip rows it covered. Run it after L2 LinkedIn repair, on rows that
have a verified LinkedIn URL and still lack a personal hash.

Filtering the send set that way is the only saving available. In one production
run where ContactOut went last against the full set, 979 of its 1,691 returned
hashes were already in the pool, so about 58% of the spend bought nothing new.

In this recipe, though, prefer to include rows that already have a hash. About a
third of what ContactOut returns is a second or third address for a person it
already matched, measured live at 228 matched profiles returning 313 hashes.
Extra addresses per person raise the odds a platform matches that person at all,
which is the whole point of a max-coverage run. Pass
`includeRowsWithExistingHash` to the hash-pool play. Drop back to the default
exclusion only when the budget cap bites.

It behaves differently from the per-row hash providers, so treat it separately:

- **Batch only.** Send 5–100 unique LinkedIn URLs per call. Fewer than 5 is
  rejected with HTTP 400. Chunk the eligible rows and keep chunks at 100.
- **The result is an unattributed hash pool.** ContactOut returns a flat
  `matches.emails` list with no mapping back to the input profiles. You cannot
  tell which hash belongs to which person, so do not write these hashes into
  per-row `email_sha256` cells. Merge them into the audience-level hash pool.
- **Billing is per matched profile.** The response includes `matches_found`,
  the exact number of profiles matched. One matched profile can return several
  hashes, so `matches.emails.length` overstates it. Report cost from
  `matches_found`, never from the hash count.
- **A zero-match chunk returns HTTP 404** with `No hashed emails found`. That
  is a normal empty result, not a failure. Keep processing the other chunks.

Because the output is pool-level, measure its contribution as net-new unique
hashes added to the pool after deduping against hashes you already had:

```text
contactout_net_new = |contactout_hashes - existing_pool|
```

Report that net-new count and the summed `matches_found`. Do not report
ContactOut lift as a per-row hit rate.

### L4: Raw Personal-Email Waterfall

Run this only when max coverage is requested and the budget cap covers it.

Try raw personal-email providers on rows still missing a personal email hash after the cost-effective hash pass. Do not exclude a row merely because it has a work email hash.

1. LeadMagic personal email
2. ContactOut pre-check, then paid reveal only for true rows
3. Wiza
4. Datagma
5. Crustdata
6. Prospeo
7. FullEnrich
8. People Data Labs or Deepline native personal-email waterfall

Provider output rules:

- include only fields explicitly typed as personal email;
- reject untyped scalar emails when they may be work emails;
- normalize raw personal emails with trim + lowercase;
- validate email syntax;
- SHA-256 hash exactly once;
- upload only `email_sha256` by default.

### L5: Phone Hashes

Do not buy mobile phones by default.

Use phone hashes only when:

- phones are already present and permitted; or
- the user explicitly approves mobile-phone enrichment and the budget cap.

Normalize phones consistently before hashing. Report phone-derived lift separately from email-derived lift.

### L6: Upload Variants

Create separate upload objects:

- baseline work identifiers
- baseline plus existing personal hashes
- baseline plus Aviato/LimaData personal hashes
- baseline plus max-coverage personal-email fallback
- phone-hash variant if used
- geo or account-tier cuts when relevant

Do not overwrite variants during experimentation. Separate audiences are required to calculate lift.

### L7: Platform Readback

After upload, poll platform status:

```bash
deepline tools execute google_ads_audiences_get_audience_status --payload '{"account_id":"<google_customer_id>","audience_id":"<audience_id>"}' --json
deepline tools execute meta_audiences_get_audience_status --payload '{"ad_account_id":"act_<meta_ad_account_id>","audience_id":"<audience_id>"}' --json
deepline tools execute linkedin_ads_audiences_get_audience_status --payload '{"account_id":"<linkedin_account_id>","audience_id":"<audience_id>"}' --json
```

Do not claim success from upload receipt alone. Success requires create, sync, and readback.

## Stop Conditions

Stop expanding coverage when any of these are true:

- budget cap is reached;
- remaining rows lack enough identity context for reliable lookup;
- provider returns are mostly work emails or invalid hashes;
- marginal unique-hash lift is below the user-defined threshold;
- platform match-rate lift does not justify another fallback layer;
- geography/rights constraints block further enrichment;
- account credential preflight fails.

When stopping, report the exact blocker and the next highest-value option.

## Reliability Checks

Before upload:

- `malformed_hashes = 0`
- `raw_email_fields_in_hash_only_payload = false`
- `double_hashed_provider_hashes = 0`
- `holdout_leaks = 0`
- `duplicate_hashes` are deduped before upload
- account name and ID are confirmed
- upload permission is confirmed

After upload:

- audience exists in the right account
- membership status is open or processing
- upload key type is correct
- invalid rows are reported
- match rate is reported only after platform returns it

## Final Report Shape

Use this structure:

```text
Coverage mode: max_coverage
Source rows:
Holdout rows:
Uploadable baseline rows:
Final uploadable rows:
Unique hashes by layer:
Remaining no-personal-hash rows:
Deepline spend:
Audience IDs by platform:
Current platform match rates:
Incremental matched people:
Cost per incremental matched person:
Recommended activation audience:
Remaining blockers:
```

The recommendation should be based on platform match-rate readback and economics, not on the file with the most enriched columns.
