# Finding companies and contacts

Turn an ICP into a company set, then contacts at those companies. No rows exist
yet; the moment you have row-shaped output, hand off to `enriching.md`. This page
is complete for discovery.

## Pilot and compile

Pilot on one schema-probe partition, then 3–5 stratified ones. Count only items
that pass the gates — company identity before company-derived contacts, a
canonical dedup key before a discovery item counts. Classify each attempt as
retrieved, no-results, partial, rate-limited, auth-failed, unreachable, timeout,
schema-drift, or error; only retrieved and no-results enter the denominator.

Selection chooses routes; compilation chooses when to call them. Three shapes:

```text
one answer per row   rows → cheap direct route → verified fills
                                └→ misses → identifier route → misses → aggregator

ranked discovery     structured search ─┐
                     SERP extraction ───┼→ canonical fusion → rerank → enrich survivors
                     registry search ───┘

multi-hop            company candidates → canonical company resolution
                       → scoped people routes in parallel → person identity/title gate
                       → contact recovery waterfall → validator
```

Never run contact providers before the person gate: a cheap wrong identity
poisons every expensive downstream call. For ranked discovery the union of
complementary routes is the product, so run them concurrently and fuse on
canonical IDs. For one answer per row, order by verified marginal fills per
credit and give later routes only unresolved rows.

Stop when target coverage or list size is reached, the next route exceeds the
credit cap, the next route added no verified unit in the pilot, two attempts of
the same mechanism family produced nothing new, or the remaining gaps need a
source or credential outside the authorized scope. Persist unresolved rows and
gap reasons; they are the next iteration's input, not permission to fabricate.

Before delivery, assert the artifact schema against the frozen contract in code:
exact CSV header names, exact top-level JSON keys, stable denominator keys, row
counts. Do not substitute `company` for `company_name` or nest a requested
top-level field.

## Companies first, then people

When a task needs contacts at ICP-matching companies, build the company set first, then find people at each company. Going straight to broad people search ("VPs of Marketing at fintechs") returns lower-quality candidates: people-search filters are coarser than firmographic ones, and the people scatter across companies you never validated. The exception is a named company list where the user only needs contacts.

Route by the fact the user actually wants, not by tool name. "Fintechs hiring fraud engineers" is _funding round + headcount + HQ + hiring evidence_ — start from a structured company provider and join job-listing evidence. Trying every tool that mentions "company" burns credits and gives inconsistent runs. Do not use generic web search or a speculative AI-generated list as the primary source.

## Finding companies

You do not have rows yet. Search a listed Play for the workflow first; if none
fits, use `deepline tools search` and `tools describe` to bind the provider
contract into the generated experiment Play. A direct provider call is one
sentinel probe for a getter or payload, never the row-collection workflow.

**Execution gate for company → contact asks:** unless the user supplied the
company rows, stage one is a live provider-backed company-discovery Play. Public
research may seed filters or strategy cards, but not a hand-picked final cohort.
Stage two receives the accepted company dataset and runs its own contact-route
comparison. Each unknown stage gets two active alternatives and, when the
catalog offers one, a dormant recovery route. A malformed getter pauses that
route: inspect and repair it or replace it before treating the row as a miss.

When five or more routes are viable, bind at least two additional, materially
different dormant company or contact routes. Each needs an actual described
getter or literal source artifact. A call followed by an unconditional empty
`results` return is not a route test; it hides a mapping gap and falsely
shrinks the recovery pool.

The durable artifact has two experiment receipts, not a serial provider loop:

1. A company-discovery experiment compares the same bounded market partition
   across two routes, keeps a third route dormant, and emits an accepted company
   dataset with the qualification claims.
2. A company-scoped people experiment receives that dataset, compares two
   contact mechanisms on the same first companies, then applies the observed
   winner to later companies and opens its dormant route only for missing or
   rejected contacts.

For this two-stage shape, vary the information geometry, not just the vendor:

- company candidate index: a structured company/search/registry route that can
  enumerate a bounded population;
- company qualifier: an official site, filing, registry, or cited-web route
  that proves the requested business role and revenue condition;
- person candidate index: a current-role/profile route keyed by accepted domain;
- role qualifier: a first-party leadership page or cited-web/profile route that
  proves the exact current responsibility and, when requested, profile URL.

Two indexes can compete on coverage and price, but they are a fragile pair when
they share a taxonomy mistake or a missing person getter. Register the proof
route as a separate end-to-end program or a dormant recovery program. On an
index miss, move to the independent proof route before declaring the row empty.

For an open-world company ask, stage-one `rows` are search partitions, not
company names. Use bounded scopes such as a registry page, a geography × NAICS
slice, a directory page, or a query shard. The discovery programs emit company
domains and qualification claims. A remembered list of famous companies is not
a discovery cohort, even if every name later verifies.

Keep the handoff boring code. Do not make contact calls while the company route
is still being debugged. First run the company experiment to a completed
`companyExperiment`, then derive the next stage's rows from accepted results:

For an open-world request, write those partitions in `companyRows` and bind two
or more company programs to them. A provider index and a first-party/registry
qualifier are useful routes when each can produce the company-stage contract.
Annual reports and known-company pages can attach proof after discovery; they
do not substitute for the company experiment. Use the generated
`--company-to-person` runner command for the first output so it verifies both
experiments and the accepted-company handoff before exporting.

```ts
const contactRows = companyExperiment.finalResults
  .filter((result) => result.complete)
  .map((result) => ({
    domain: verifiedSearchClaimValue<string>(result, 'company_domain'),
    company_name: verifiedSearchClaimValue<string>(result, 'company_name'),
  }));

const contactExperiment = await runSearchExperiment({
  ctx,
  rows: contactRows,
  definition: {
    contract: contactContract,
    programs: contactPrograms,
    explorationProgramCount: 2,
  },
});
```

The only stage seam is the accepted company row. Define company claims
(`company_name`, `company_domain`, qualification evidence) and contact claims
(name, current responsibility, profile/evidence) separately. If the company
experiment produces too few accepted rows, repair or supplement it before
authoring the contact calls. This makes provider payload debugging local: one
sentinel per route, one stage at a time.

Do not retain a `harvestedCompanies`, `rawCandidates`, or similar side list to
feed contacts. Those are retrieval candidates, not accepted companies. The
only legitimate contact input is the mapped `companyExperiment.finalResults`
above. If that leaves too few rows, the company experiment has exposed the
actual gap: add or repair a qualification route, then rerun that stage.

Do not collapse those columns into one JSON `company_profile` / `contact_profile`
claim. The experiments need separate required claims for revenue, revenue
evidence, contact name, exact title, current-company evidence, and LinkedIn
when the user requested it. A person result passes only when its title or bound
responsibility evidence names sales, commercial, revenue, growth, customer, or
business development. A generic CEO is not a closest-role fallback.

Make the business qualifier a claim, not a loose provider filter. If the ask is
for operators, owners, manufacturers, care providers, or another semantic
subclass, bind evidence that the company performs that role and encode obvious
exclusions. A matching industry label or keyword alone does not prove it: it
will admit suppliers, contractors, agencies, directories, and similar near
misses. The same rule applies to revenue, geography, scale, and recency.

Direct provider probes are allowed to learn a payload or getter. They do not
replace either experiment receipt. For a request for ten contacts, aim to
produce more than ten qualified companies upstream so a real contact miss does
not force an unsupported substitute; nevertheless, preserve and recover every
accepted company row until the requested coverage is met or the absence ledger
says it cannot be.
The people stage follows the same rule. It starts with competing contact routes
on shared accepted companies, then applies an observed route to later companies.
If a people index stalls, misses, or exposes an adapter seam, keep that company
on the frontier and spend the next distinct contact route on it. A single
provider batch over every accepted company is a collection pass, not a
coverage-learning experiment.

When a database comes up thin, change where the fact lives:

| You need                                                      | Route                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Companies by funding round, headcount, HQ, category           | structured company search plus qualifying-source verification |
| Companies hiring for a role                                   | job-listing/search tool joined to the company set             |
| Companies in a portfolio / accelerator batch / curated source | `deepline plays search "<source> company list" --json` first  |
| Reactors/commenters on a LinkedIn post                        | `deepline plays search engagers --json`                       |

```bash
deepline tools search "company search funding headcount category hq" --json
deepline tools describe <tool-id> --json
deepline tools execute <tool-id> --payload '{"hq_country":"USA","funding_round":["Series A","Series B"],"employee_count":{"min":50,"max":500},"limit":1}' --json
deepline plays check ./company-discovery.play.ts
deepline plays run ./company-discovery.play.ts --input '{"target_count":25}' --watch
```

Tools are the live provider catalog; plays are the workflow surface. One direct
call may probe a route's real input and output shape. The second paid call for
the JTBD belongs inside the experiment Play: make the strongest known route the
incumbent, add a heterogeneous challenger, and keep the rest dormant. Otherwise
the terminal becomes a manual waterfall that cannot reuse receipts, learn an
order, or reopen failed rows. When `tools execute --json` returns a
`starter_script`, use it as the program body draft. Keep durable stage names
stable: candidate pull, evidence attachment, contact lookup, email waterfall,
export.

**Durable discovery rules** (the difference between "built the list from real data" and "fell back to training-data names after tool friction"):

- **Count before pulling.** Ask the source how many it has (a count endpoint, or `limit: 1` as a shape-and-size probe) before pulling pages. Pulling 100 when the source has 18 inflates cost; pulling 25 when it has 4,000 silently truncates the breadth without telling the user.
- **Validate enum-like filters first.** Industry codes, category strings, country codes, and funding-round labels often validate against a closed enum. Sending `"financial services"` where the provider wants `"Financial Services"` (or `54`) returns zero results with no error. Use the provider's autocomplete/enum endpoint on a sample value (`deepline tools search autocomplete --json`) before the full search.
- **ISO 3-letter country codes for HQ filters.** Most structured company providers want `USA`, `GBR`, `DEU`, not `"United States"`. The country filter is the most common silent-failure mode — the request succeeds, the count is zero, and the agent wrongly concludes "no companies match."
- **Filter, then supplement; do not re-discover.** When a pass returns mostly good rows and a few bad ones, drop the bad and supplement gaps from a second source. The noise is in the data, not the query — re-running the primary search with new filters chasing a cleaner set rarely helps.
- **Do not salvage discovery with domain-by-domain enrichment loops.** For "build a list of N companies matching criteria," domain-by-domain enrichment is a gap-fill step after you have a candidate set, not a discovery strategy. If you catch yourself looping over hand-picked domains, return to a provider-native company/job search with broader filters. **Hard stop:** after two provider searches and one supplement pass, write the valid rows with evidence, broaden one filter and rerun, or report the criteria were too narrow.

Preserve the response's evidence columns when writing the CSV: `funding_round`, `last_funding_at`, `employee_count`, `growth_6m_percent`, `hq_city`, `hq_country`, `industry_codes`, `description` — the proof that justifies each row.

For "companies hiring fraud engineers," pull job listings and group by company; preserve `hiring_role`, `hiring_url`, `hiring_posted_at`, `hiring_count`. When the user only needs _whether_ a company is hiring (not for what role), the cheaper path is the `growth_6m_percent`-style field many firmographic searches return for free.

For thin coverage (<50-employee companies, niche verticals, recent batches),
switch source geometry once you have named companies: retrieve a bounded public
employee roster, staff directory, association list, or vertical database, then
filter for the persona. Rephrasing a genuinely empty structured-provider query
does not create coverage.

## Finding contacts

### Named-company domain recovery

Treat a company name as enough to begin a named-account task. When a downstream
contact or enrichment route requires a domain, resolve and verify the canonical
domain before calling it; do not ask the user to supply a comma-separated list
of domains. Search the live capability map for a company/domain-resolution or
web-search route, inspect its contract, and prefer a free or no-credit first
pass when one is available.

Accept a hostname only after its official page identifies the same company.
Keep `company_name`, normalized `domain`, `domain_evidence_url`, and
`domain_confidence` in the input dataset. A directory, LinkedIn, or a search
result is evidence for a lead, not the company domain itself. If a common name
has multiple plausible companies, use supplied location, product, person, or
company-profile context to disambiguate. When that still cannot establish an
identity, retain an unresolved row with attempted routes and a miss reason,
then continue with the remaining companies instead of blocking the whole job.

**Broad function + seniority across companies; exact titles are only one route
at a known company.** People search across many companies ("VPs of Marketing at
US fintechs") uses a broad functional category plus seniority —
`function: ["Marketing"]`, `seniority: ["VP", "Director"]`. Exact title arrays
miss real titles because spelling varies wildly. At a known company, include an
exact-title route when intent is specific, but search the complete
user-supplied title family and compare it with an independent
function/seniority or public-evidence route. Never shrink the acceptance set to
the easiest titles or treat the exact-title route as the market. Spelling and
word-order equivalents may stay strict; adjacent functions, lower seniority,
former holders, and reporting-line proxies are relaxations and need approval.

“Closest role” means the closest **supported responsibility**, not the highest
person in the org chart. A CEO is not a sales, commercial, clinical, security,
or product leader merely because the CEO ultimately owns the company. Accept a
fallback only when current evidence names the requested responsibility. When a
user asks for N qualified contacts, over-provision companies and keep searching
until N people pass that semantic contract; do not fill the count with generic
executives.

```bash
# People across companies
deepline tools search "people search" --json
deepline tools execute <tool-id> --payload '{"function":"Marketing","seniority":["VP","Director"],"hq_country":"USA","limit":1}' --json

# People at a known company
deepline plays search contact --json
deepline plays run <play-name> --input '{"company_name":"Acme","domain":"acme.com","roles":"VP Marketing","seniority":"VP"}' --watch
```

For a company list → contacts, a small custom Play doing company-scoped people
search is the exploit shape after the pilot above. Author each
candidate route as a `SearchProgram`; the helper creates the evidence ledger,
comparison, holdout, and scorecard. Resolving a domain from a company name is
mechanical — use a search tool
(`deepline tools search search --json`), not `deeplineagent`. Engagers on a
post output a list of people — hand off to the qualification section
(`deeplineagent` with a tier `jsonSchema`).

Company discovery and contact discovery are different stages, not competing
routes. Calling one company provider and one people provider creates a pipeline,
not consensus. Compare alternatives that answer the same stage contract, then
compose the winning company route with the winning contact route and challenge
only the gaps.

Within either stage, two title filters against one people database are one
candidate program, not two independent strategies. They may improve its recall,
but the program must return one typed outcome so the experiment can compare it
with a genuinely different route. Let `runSearchExperiment` fan program calls
out in parallel; never place the competing provider calls in `Promise.all` over
every company. That spends the fallback wave before it knows which company is a
gap.

If the two query paths have materially different observed miss behavior, they
may instead be separate coverage/economic candidates. Mark their shared source
lineage so the contract does not mistake them for independent confirmation.

## When databases come up thin: keep searching, change the route

Niche, local, and public-sector personas — city clerks, school administrators, practice managers, SMB owners — live in directories and public websites, not B2B databases. A zero from the database rung is a routing signal, not an answer: the people verifiably exist online, so keep searching until the route matches where they live.

The discovery ladder: structured entity search → maps/local search → web search
with source/domain patterns → **known-source extraction**. Once a directory,
registry, association roster, or staff section is known, traverse that bounded
source and retain its URLs as evidence. An official roster can be both more
complete and more authoritative than another open-ended search.

Persistence is not thrash. The anti-pattern the hard stop above guards against is re-running the _same_ provider with reshuffled filters; the discipline here is escalating to the _next independent route_. The hard stop applies per route — never to the mission.

## Convergence and dedup

Define the target row count up front (usually the user's ask). Over-provision
(each downstream stage loses ~15-20%), filter, and stop when
the filtered set hits target. The ~80% marginal-return heuristic applies only
when rows are interchangeable, such as building any 100 matching companies.
It does not apply to one-result-per-company work: each unresolved named entity
must enter the gap loop. Deduplicate by canonical key (domain
for companies, LinkedIn URL or email for people) **after** filtering, not before
— keying first can drop valid rows whose key is missing from one merge source.
For high-stakes signals (job changes, recent funding, leadership moves), verify
with a second source before tagging `HIGH`: single-source is `MEDIUM`,
conflicting sources are `LOW`.

When several discovery providers return ranked lists inside one program,
canonicalize people by LinkedIn URL and companies by domain, then use weighted
reciprocal-rank fusion only to form a shortlist. Apply source caps so one index
cannot fill the shortlist through aliases. Ranking is discovery; current-role,
identity, and firmographic evidence still pass the claim contract before a row
is complete. Do not use document RRF to choose the winning program.

## Exit

- Rows exist and need columns filled → `enriching.md`.
- Company set is wrong (shape right, rows wrong) → re-pick the primary source; do not fall back to training data.
- Discovery run errored, stalled, or returned zero rows → `../references/debugging.md` ("provider returns nothing").
