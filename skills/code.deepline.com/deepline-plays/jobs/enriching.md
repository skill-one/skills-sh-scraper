# Enriching rows

Row-shaped input, target columns to fill: emails, phones, LinkedIn, hydration,
signals, evidence-backed research, and qualification. This page is complete for
that job. Seed lists come from `finding.md`; public research follows
`researching.md`; outreach writing belongs in the dedicated outreach-writing
skill.

## Pilot without lying to yourself

One schema-probe row, then 3–5 stratified rows: easy, normal, sparse or niche,
and collision-prone. The scaffold's `--input-csv` writes exactly that as
`fixture.csv`. Run every candidate route on the same denominator.

Count only terminal outputs that pass the task's gates: current employer and
accepted title before a person counts; deliverability or line validity before
contact coverage; attributable evidence before a research claim counts; a
canonical dedup key before a discovery item counts. Ten candidates for the wrong
company are zero covered rows, and raw response size is not coverage.

Classify every attempt as retrieved, no-results, partial, rate-limited,
auth-failed, unreachable, timeout, schema-drift, or error. Only retrieved and
no-results belong in the coverage denominator — an adapter failure is not a
source miss.

Treat pilot and exploit as one budget. An **admission floor** is the minimum
balance needed to launch a call, which is not the amount charged; take it from
the live tool contract or the first excluded probe. Keep the pilot small enough
that at least one viable route stays admissible for the full denominator. If the
catalog exposes no floor, treat it as unknown rather than zero, probe the
cheapest route before a high-fanout paid one, and request one terminal result per
pilot row. The exploit denominator excludes rows the pilot already solved.

## Enriching rows

You have row-shaped input (CSV, JSON array, or discovery output) and a target column. Inspect the CSV with the CLI before choosing a play, so the play choice and any `--columns.*` mapping are based on the actual shape the runtime sees:

```bash
deepline csv show --csv <input.csv> --summary
```

Route by the identifiers each row has:

| You have                                                 | You need                    | Pattern category                                   | Discover with                                   |

| `/in/` LinkedIn URL + name                               | work email                  | linkedin profile → work email waterfall            | `deepline plays search email --json`            |
| `email`                                                  | hydrated person + company   | reverse contact enrichment                         | `deepline plays search contact --json`          |

## When the primary route misses

A miss on one route is not a dead row — but a second route is a purchase, not a reflex. A property's coverage ceiling is the union of independent routes. Compare candidate rungs on the small common wave, then let the experiment invoke later rungs only for unresolved rows and claims. Field-measured:

- **Mint a different identifier, then re-route.** The strongest escalation is resolving the person's LinkedIn URL and re-entering through the LinkedIn-based email pattern — it also catches stale employer data the original row carried. But bolt on a **hard identity gate**: the resolved profile's employer or geography must corroborate the row, not just the name. Name-only matching on common names confidently returns strangers' emails — a wrong-identity email is worse than a miss, and the reliable tell is an email domain that disagrees with the person's known employer.
- **Check the registry when the vertical has one** (healthcare NPI/NPPES, clinical trials, government contractors). Registries rarely hold emails but confirm identity and employer for free and often yield a verified phone — evidence that upgrades or vetoes every other route's output.
- **Test a multi-source aggregation mechanism before concluding a ceiling.**
  Browse the live email/contact categories for actions that combine independent
  upstream indexes. Prefer contracts with a pollable job ID and per-row
  deliverability status. Aggregated fills still pass the same identity and
  validation gates; provider count does not manufacture consensus.
- **Feed aggregators only validated identifiers.** An identifier you minted but did not identity-gate (a resolved LinkedIn URL that merely name-matched) poisons aggregator matching — it returns the wrong person with confidence. Gate minted identifiers before any downstream rung.
- **Check credentials before planning a rung.** Some providers are bring-your-own-credentials (`tools describe` shows the billing source); without a linked account every call fails closed with a credentials error. Confirm the connection or drop the rung — do not count it in projected coverage.
- **Cut losing rungs fast.** If a rung's first ~5 attempts return nothing usable, stop it — people-search databases and pattern-guessing often hold nothing for a niche population, and burning the full set proves nothing the first five didn't. Read the COST RECEIPT's CUT CANDIDATE lines: one run kept a rung at 3.95 credits/call for ten rounds and zero results because the scorecard showed no cost.
- **Emit every fact the evidence already paid for.** A registry or maps route that returned a verified phone while resolving the practice was already billed for it. One run held that phone in a local variable, never emitted it, and shipped nulls for a cohort where 19 of 43 were hospital-employed with no public mailbox. Add the column before concluding the ceiling.
- **Recognize a structural ceiling — after the aggregator rung.** Some populations keep work emails behind directories few sources index, and their mail domains block SMTP validation, so correct pattern guesses can't be promoted to fills. Once waterfall, re-route, registry, and aggregator rungs are all measured, the right output is the validated fills, honest nulls with miss reasons, and a channel pivot the evidence already paid for (verified practice phone, mobile). Report the measured ceiling instead of buying the same misses again.

After a phone is recovered, validate line type and activity with a phone validator (`deepline tools search phone --json`). A number that connects to the wrong person costs more than a missing number.

**Cohort patches are not the method.** A domain blocklist, place-name stopwords, or a specialty regex tuned to one roster do not port to the next job. Three rules do: a URL must corroborate the name it is attached to (use `coherenceChecks`); consensus must be scoped to the relevant sub-population; and a derived contact needs independent verification. Carry those forward, not the lists.

Plays encode provider sequencing, validation, row progress, and retry behavior — row-level enrichment should run through a prebuilt or scratchpad play, not loose `tools execute` calls. Keep custom `definePlay(...)` names short (`email-wf`, `phone-wf`, `company-fit`): the persisted sheet table is `normalized play name + ctx.dataset key`, and Postgres caps that combined identifier at 63 characters.

When source headers do not match a play's canonical names, pass column aliases at invocation instead of editing the play — the play gets canonical fields in code while persisted output keeps the user's original headers next to derived columns:

```bash
deepline plays run <play-name> \
  --input '{"csv":"leads.csv","columns":{"first_name":"First Name","last_name":"Last Name","domain":"Website"}}' \
  --watch
deepline runs export <run-id> --out leads_with_emails.csv
```

The batch phone play defaults to headers `FIRST_NAME`, `LAST_NAME`, `COMPANY_DOMAIN`, `CONTACT_EMAIL`, `LINKEDIN_URL`; the job-change play adds `COMPANY_NAME`, `TITLE`. Job-change output appends `job_change`, `job_changed`, `confidence_tier`, `new_company`, `new_title` — treat `HIGH` as detector-and-verification agreement, `MEDIUM` as a single-source signal, `LOW` as no reliable change. Pilot job-change on two data rows (`head -3 input.csv > pilot.csv`) because its multiple provider branches can hide a missing-column or verification-path issue on a single row.

**Run shapes.** A proven scalar or batch prebuilt is the incumbent, not the
whole experiment. For live coverage work, compare it with one heterogeneous
challenger on the smallest shared row set, then exploit the observed winner and
open dormant routes only for unresolved rows. Compose a scalar prebuilt inside
an incumbent `SearchProgram` with `ctx.runPlay(...)`; the prebuilt carries the
current provider order, fallbacks, normalization, and no-result handling. Use a
stable step key inside the dataset; row identity comes from `ctx.dataset`, so do
not generate per-row keys. The child play returns an object
(`{ email, email_source, ... }`) — **extract the scalar** so the column exports
cleanly:

Before choosing a known or prebuilt route, describe it and record its Deepline
credit quote or catalog ceiling beside the row-level stop rule. If neither is
available, label cost `unknown`; do not omit it or infer zero.

```typescript
const enriched = await ctx
  .dataset('linkedin_email_waterfall', rows)
  .withColumn('email', async (row, rowCtx) => {
    const result = await rowCtx.runPlay<{ email: string | null }>(
      'linkedin_email',
      'prebuilt/person-linkedin-to-email',
      {
        linkedin_url: row.linkedin_url,
        first_name: row.first_name,
        last_name: row.last_name,
        domain: row.domain,
      },
      { description: 'Resolve work email from LinkedIn profile.' },
    );
    return result.email ?? null;
  })
  .run({ key: 'linkedin_url', description: 'Resolve work emails per row.' });
```

Drop to `ctx.tools.execute(...)` only when you need one explicit provider call the prebuilt does not expose. For uncertain manual fallbacks, use the dataset-conditioned experiment, not vendor reputation. Give each program a stable `id`; the helper compares on common rows, then calls alternatives only for unresolved gaps.

**Probe the discovery provider's real output before hand-authoring.** The reruns in a custom composition come from provider output shape, not logic. Run the discovery tool once (`deepline tools execute <ref> --input '{...}' --json`), inspect the real payload, then **derive the row key from a guaranteed-present field** (a domain, a stable id) and **assume identifiers can be null** — a LinkedIn URL, a phone, a secondary email are all optionally absent. Keying a `ctx.dataset` on an identifier that some rows lack is what cost a CTO pilot its rerun loop: blank-LinkedIn rows broke the row key, forcing an edit→preflight→run cycle a five-second probe would have prevented.

### Durable enrichment gotchas

- **Sales Navigator URLs do not work in email waterfalls.** `linkedin.com/sales/lead/...` URLs are rejected by every provider that accepts a LinkedIn URL — they are scoped to a Sales Navigator session and have no public-profile equivalent. Feeding them into a waterfall returns zero matches everywhere, even though the same person's `/in/` URL would resolve. Detect the form (`/linkedin\.com\/sales\/lead\//`), resolve the company domain first, then use name + domain.
- **Personal vs work email is a hard provider split.** "Personal emails" means Gmail/Hotmail/Yahoo/Outlook — the address that follows the person across jobs. Work-email providers (Hunter, LeadMagic) return `@company.com` regardless, because that is the only class they index. Routing a personal-email request to a work-email provider lands the campaign in someone's corporate inbox and burns deliverability. Find the personal-email play with `deepline plays search "personal email" --json`.
- **Email status is a normalized contract; catch-all means verify, not send.** Statuses: `valid`, `valid_catch_all`, `catch_all`, `unknown`, `invalid`, `do_not_mail`, `spamtrap`, `abuse`, `disposable`. Verdicts: `valid` → send; `valid_catch_all` → send with caution; `catch_all` → `verify_next` (domain accepts mail at any address, so the inbox is unproven — verify with a second independent finder, do not count it as a confirmed pattern hit inside a waterfall); `unknown` → hold; the rest → drop. A `catch_all` whose domain does not match the person's company domain is a strong wrong-person signal (often a previous employer) — flag rather than send.
- **Validation follows candidate recovery but precedes claim completion.** Do not validate empty finder attempts, but do not let an unvalidated candidate close `work_email`. A separate `email_validation` dataset is safe only when its rejection reopens the experiment row; otherwise the helper optimizes raw finder coverage and cannot challenge invalid or catch-all results. In an adaptive experiment, make validators acceptance programs that consume candidate emails and produce the final accepted claim. Each physical dataset still needs a distinct key after normalization (`email_waterfall`, then `email_validation`) because reusing a key fails registration.
- **Key candidate emails by normalized email, not by the lead row.** The input
  unit stays the lead's stable `rowKey`; every finder result uses the normalized
  candidate email as `resultKey` and `canonicalEntityKey`. Then agreement merges
  on one candidate, disagreement remains multiple testable candidates, and a
  verifier can reject one without poisoning the rest.
- **A verifier advances through candidates.** Sort candidate identities by
  observed agreement and finder evidence, then test the bounded slice. Emit a
  typed rejection result for every invalid, catch-all, unknown, or mismatched
  verifier outcome; do not return an empty attempt or keep calling only
  `candidates[0]` while a sibling remains untested. Different finder candidates
  are alternatives, not rejection evidence. A verifier returning an email other
  than the candidate is the hard `rejected:disagreement` case.
- **Use provider data directly when it is already there.** Company/contact responses often include firmographics, employment history, validation status, and confidence in the same payload. Re-running a `deeplineagent` column to get an industry the discovery provider already returned wastes credits and adds synthesis error. AI is for synthesis the providers cannot do, not for re-deriving fields they handed back.
- **Validate the person before trusting a recovered LinkedIn URL.** Searched-recovered URLs (from name + company) carry a substantial false-positive rate without a name gate: null out URLs where last name does not match exactly or as a substring, or first name does not match exactly / by 3+ char prefix / by a known nickname. Full treatment in the sibling `linkedin-url-lookup` skill.
- **Email domain ≠ company domain.** After recovery, compare each row's email domain against the company domain it should belong to. Mismatches are often previous-employer or wrong-person matches; more than ~20% mismatch means the contact-finding step needs re-running with better company disambiguation.

Inside a play, tool results serialize like `deepline tools execute --json`: execution metadata is top-level, raw provider data is `toolResponse.raw`, tool metadata is `toolResponse.meta`, semantic extractions are `extractedValues` / `extractedLists`.

## Compare first, then build the waterfall

For enrichment with uncertain coverage:

1. Inventory the full relevant tool categories. Put every route you can bind
   correctly, including the cheapest prebuilt and useful provider siblings,
   into one task-authored Play as compact `SearchProgram` functions. The helper
   executes a small heterogeneous wave and keeps the rest dormant.
2. Bind raw evidence and verify each candidate field before it can close a
   claim. A retrieved person or URL is a lead, not a filled field.
3. Let `runSearchExperiment(...)` compare them on shared dataset-chosen
   sentinels, then run later programs only for unresolved claims.
   Keep topology counts unset by default so the helper reserves untouched
   exploitation rows; do not turn a tiny dataset into all-comparison rows.
4. Let the same run confirm the learned order on untouched rows, enrich in
   batches, and probe unused programs on any comparison, holdout, or batch row
   the current waterfall failed. Useful challengers join later batches automatically, replacing a
   noncausal fallback when the configured waterfall is already full.
5. Report `experiment.leverage`, the fair comparison's `costCoverageFrontier`,
   and the COST RECEIPT block from `scripts/cost-receipt.py` verbatim. Declare
   each program's `tools: [...]` so that block can attribute observed credits per
   route; without it the scorecard can only show a catalog upper bound. Never
   copy a catalog price into a per-attempt credit field or turn unknown spend
   into zero, and never divide total credits by successes.

The helper bounds comparison and challenge work to small shared units. The
remaining work is best-first, so a useful primary does not force every fallback
across every row. Routes that have never completed a row receive at most two
live challenge rows. A displaced route already proven on this dataset remains
eligible when a later row exposes its stratum again.

## Custom AI research and qualification

Deterministic logic — normalization, coalescing, templating, parsing, formatting — is plain TypeScript in the play body or a `withColumn` resolver. There is no `run_javascript` tool inside plays; the runtime rejects it. `deeplineagent` is for synthesis: research, classification, scoring, structured generation. Reach for the deterministic option first. Use `jsonSchema` for any structured output a downstream step reads, and confirm the live model menu with `deepline tools describe deeplineagent --json`.

For company or market research, read `researching.md` first. Retrieve and
persist attributable public evidence before synthesis. A single
`deeplineagent` answer is not a research route, and an evidence-free schema is
not a deliverable research column.

```typescript
const research = await ctx.tools.execute({
  id: 'company_research',
  tool: 'deeplineagent',
  input: {
    model: '<model-id-from-describe>',
    prompt: `Using only the supplied evidence rows, research ${row.company_name} (${row.domain}). Return supported claims or insufficient_evidence.`,
    jsonSchema: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        what_they_build: { type: ['string', 'null'] },
        who_they_sell_to: { type: ['string', 'null'] },
        supporting_evidence_ids: {
          type: 'array',
          items: { type: 'string' },
        },
        research_status: {
          type: 'string',
          enum: ['supported', 'partial', 'insufficient_evidence'],
        },
      },
      required: [
        'what_they_build',
        'who_they_sell_to',
        'supporting_evidence_ids',
        'research_status',
      ],
      additionalProperties: false,
    },
  },
  description: 'Research company positioning for enrichment.',
});
```

Scoring and qualification are claim-contract decisions. A bounded AI step may
prioritize an already retrieved lead shortlist, but it cannot verify a fact,
complete a row, or override a deterministic evidence gate. Record its output
as source-bound supplemental evidence and let `research-experiment.ts` decide
whether the claim passes.

- **Person vs ICP → tier:** run the prebuilt `prebuilt/engagers-to-icp-qualification`. Its output is `{ icp_tier: 'tier1' | 'tier2' | 'tier3', icp_reason }`: a structured tier plus a one-sentence reason, exactly the ICP-engagement classification a list of reactors needs.
- **Anything else** (account/company fit, a custom lead score, a ranking): call `deeplineagent` with a constrained `jsonSchema` (the block above), or `enrich --with '{"tool":"deeplineagent","payload":{"prompt":...,"jsonSchema":...}}'`. Use an enum for a tier plus a `reason` field, grounded only on the provided context.

**Flatten structured output before deterministic reuse.** `deeplineagent` structured columns are wrapped in a result envelope. Interpolating `{{column}}` into another prompt usually works; field-level `{{column.field}}` does not. When a downstream step needs a field, add a plain-TypeScript flatten column that emits a scalar — the structured payload is at `toolResponse.raw.extracted_json`.

## Exit

- Research columns exist and copy is next → use the outreach-writing skill.
- Ranking an uncertain route or QA before shipping → run the pilot and untouched holdout above.
- A run failed, stalled, or output looks wrong → `../references/debugging.md`.
