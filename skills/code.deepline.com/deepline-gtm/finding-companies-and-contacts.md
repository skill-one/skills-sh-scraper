# Finding Companies and Contacts (JTBD Draft)

Use this doc for discovery, sourcing, TAM/list building, known-source extraction, contact discovery, and hiring-qualified company search before any row-level enrichment.

This doc does **not** cover email waterfalls, row-level play mechanics, coalescing, validation, or personalization columns. If you already have rows and need to fill or transform columns, stop and use `enriching-and-researching.md`.

## Core rules

Default to discovery/search here. The moment the work becomes per-row enrichment, hand off to `enriching-and-researching.md`.

**Companies first, then people.** When the task involves finding contacts at companies matching criteria (ICP, portfolio, accelerator, hiring signal), always discover the company set first, then search for people at those companies. Do not start with people-search tools (`exa_people_search`, `dropleads_search_people`, etc.) using broad title+industry queries — you will get noisy, unaffiliated results. The only exception is when the user provides a specific named company list and only needs contacts.

Use a list-building/search subagent for non-trivial multi-provider discovery. Tell subagents to read this file; keep small obvious lookups inline.

Subagent output contract:

- return a seed CSV or structured list only
- preserve source lineage
- stop before row-level enrichment
- recommend the next step

Search-to-enrichment handoff rules:

- stop adding ad-hoc row-level scripts once you have a seed list
- move per-column work to a play per `enriching-and-researching.md`
- keep lineage in-sheet with `_metadata`

## Company search providers (ROI order)

Escalate only when you need a filter the current step lacks.

1. **`free_simple_company_search`** — SQL over the free company corpus. Exact/domain lookup and bounded SQL. FREE.
2. **`dropleads_search_people`** — adds revenue, funding range, technologies + people filters. Use `dropleads_get_lead_count` to size first. FREE.
3. **`crustdata_companydb_search`** — adds investors, funding stage, fuzzy `(.)` operator. Use `crustdata_companydb_autocomplete` (free) first.

**When DB providers return 0** (pre-revenue startups, niche verticals, non-US): use `exa_company_search` for concept search, `parallel_extract` for known source URLs, `serper_google_maps_search` for local/SMB, and `serper_google_search` for scoped directory discovery.

## Tool discovery

Use `deepline tools search` once near the top when the scenario is clear but the exact tool family is not. Provide an intent query, or omit it only when `--categories` or `--search_terms` supplies the structured search; both filters accept comma-separated values. Provider names belong in the query, not in a `--prefix` flag.

Prefer category-constrained searches. More search terms helps with recall. Then inspect the strongest candidates.

```bash
deepline tools search --categories company_search --search_terms "structured filters,firmographics" &
deepline tools search --categories people_search --search_terms "title filters,linkedin" &
deepline tools search --categories company_search --search_terms "investors,funding" &
deepline tools search --categories research --search_terms "ads,technographics" &
wait

deepline tools describe crustdata_companydb_search &
deepline tools describe dropleads_search_people &
deepline tools describe apify_run_actor_sync &
wait
```

After tool discovery, shortlist 1-2 candidates, inspect schemas, validate enum-like inputs, then run a narrow first pass.

## People search providers (ROI order)

1. **`wiza_search_prospects`** — 30 masked results, no contact data. Good for sizing. FREE.
2. **`dropleads_search_people`** — workhorse: title, seniority, dept, geo, tech, revenue. Near-zero coverage <50 emp. FREE.
3. **`crustdata_persondb_search`** — cheapest bulk paid. Use `crustdata_persondb_autocomplete` (free) first.
4. **`lusha_search_contacts`** — dept, seniority, industry, title, tech filters.
5. **`ai_ark_people_search`** — title, seniority, skills, location, company attributes.

**Alts:** `exa_people_search` (tiny startups); `contactout_search_people`; `icypeas_find_people` (700M+ DB); `rocketreach_search_people` (30+ filters).

## Discovery workflow

| Step | What to do                                                 | Why                                             |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Check if the data already exists or has a known source URL | Avoid unnecessary provider calls                |
| 1    | Shortlist 1-2 providers from the reference table           | Prevent random provider thrash                  |
| 2    | Inspect the schema with `deepline tools describe`          | Avoid guessed field names and bad payloads      |
| 3    | Validate enum-like values with autocomplete tools          | Prevent silent empty searches                   |
| 4    | Execute a count-like or narrow first pass                  | Cheaply confirm fit before full pull            |
| 5    | Prefer result-priced routes when coverage is uncertain     | Avoid paying per miss during exploratory fanout |

Anti-patterns:

- **jumping to people-search first** — searching for "GTM Engineer at YC startup" via `exa_people_search` or `dropleads_search_people` before having a company list. Find companies first, then find people at each.
- reconstructing a known directory with repeated search queries
- firing all providers in parallel before routing
- guessing filter names or enum values
- using `deeplineagent` as the default discovery path here.
- continuing row-level logic / enrichment/research here after a seed list exists

## Search audiences

Use when sizing reachability, volume, or market fit — "how many people can we reach?", "is this market big enough?", "pull 100k leads".

**Count-first invariant:** prefer a dedicated count endpoint. Otherwise run with `limit:1` / `per_page:1` / `size:1` and read totals. Pull full pages only after shape + size look right.

For large payloads or Windows/PowerShell quoting trouble, write the JSON to a file and pass `--payload @path/to/payload.json`; generated payloads can use `--payload-stdin`.

### Sizing a people audience

Default to Dropleads first (strongest free first pass, LinkedIn-rich). Fall back to Wiza/Forager/Icypeas/Prospeo/PDL.

```bash
deepline tools execute dropleads_get_lead_count --payload '{"filters":{"jobTitles":["CEO"],"industries":["Technology"]}}'
deepline tools execute dropleads_search_people --payload '{"filters":{"jobTitles":["VP Sales"],"industries":["Technology"]},"pagination":{"page":1,"limit":1}}'
deepline tools execute forager_person_role_search_totals --payload '{"role_title":"\"Software Engineer\""}'
deepline tools execute icypeas_count_people --payload '{"query":{"currentJobTitle":{"include":["CTO"]}}}'
deepline tools execute peopledatalabs_person_search --payload '{"query":{"bool":{"must":[{"term":{"location_country":"United States"}},{"term":{"job_title_role":"marketing"}}]}},"size":1}'
```

### Sizing a company audience (ICP)

Structured company path at `limit:1`, or dedicated totals.

```bash
deepline tools execute crustdata_companydb_search --payload '{"filters":[{"filter_type":"crunchbase_categories","type":"in","value":["Identity Management","Fraud Detection"]},{"filter_type":"hq_country","type":"=","value":"USA"},{"filter_type":"employee_count_range","type":"in","value":["51-200","201-500"]},{"filter_type":"last_funding_round_type","type":"in","value":["Series A","Series B"]}],"limit":1}'
deepline tools execute forager_organization_search_totals --payload '{"industries":[1]}'
deepline tools execute prospeo_search_company --payload '{"company":{"names":{"include":["Intercom"]},"websites":{"include":["intercom.com"]}},"page":1}'
```

### Sizing hiring demand

Use when the question is "how many companies are hiring this role?" (job-market size). For hiring evidence on a known company set, use `crustdata_v2_job_search` in the Hiring-qualified section below.

```bash
deepline tools execute forager_job_search_totals --payload '{"title":"\"Sales Engineer\""}'
deepline tools execute hunter_discover --payload '{"query":"B2B SaaS companies","limit":1}'
```

### Rough domain-level signal

Quick directional answer about a single company — not a persona-level audience estimate. Domain email volume ≠ reachable persona count.

```bash
deepline tools execute hunter_email_count --payload '{"domain":"stripe.com"}'
```

## Structured company search

Use this section when the user has a crisp ICP, such as:

- funding stage
- headcount range
- geography
- vertical/category
- investor
- hiring proxy or company maturity

Recommended course of action:

1. Use structured company search first.
2. Validate enum-like values before committing to a full search.
3. Run a count-like first pass with `limit:1` when appropriate.
4. Pull more rows than the final target if downstream attrition is expected.
5. If the exact filter set is unclear, use the tool-discovery pattern above instead of hardcoding a provider guess.
6. Stop after a tiny pilot when usable rows are sparse, domains are missing, taxonomy is broad, or cost per usable row is high. Change source route before scaling.

### Free native company search

Use `free_simple_company_search` for exact and bounded SQL:

- exact `normalized_domain = ...` or `normalized_domain IN (...)`
- small exact `linkedin_url = ...` or `linkedin_url IN (...)` batches
- small exact `company_name = ...` or `company_name IN (...)` batches
- anchored prefix candidates like `company_name ILIKE 'acme%'`

Plain `ILIKE '%...%'` is valid SQL, but can scan the full 35M-company table with long OR chains, `COUNT`/`GROUP BY`, broad locations, or high limits. Use purpose-built providers for broad keyword discovery, strict totals, live coverage, or native facets.

### Canonical value validation

```bash
deepline tools execute crustdata_companydb_autocomplete --payload '{"field":"crunchbase_categories","query":"identity","limit":5}'
```

### Count-first structured company search

```bash
deepline tools execute crustdata_companydb_search --payload '{"filters":[{"filter_type":"crunchbase_categories","type":"in","value":["Identity Management","Fraud Detection"]},{"filter_type":"hq_country","type":"=","value":"USA"},{"filter_type":"employee_count_range","type":"in","value":["51-200","201-500"]},{"filter_type":"last_funding_round_type","type":"in","value":["Series A","Series B"]}],"limit":1}'
```

### Full structured company pull

```bash
deepline tools execute crustdata_companydb_search --payload '{"filters":[{"filter_type":"crunchbase_categories","type":"in","value":["Identity Management","Fraud Detection"]},{"filter_type":"hq_country","type":"=","value":"USA"},{"filter_type":"employee_count_range","type":"in","value":["51-200","201-500"]},{"filter_type":"last_funding_round_type","type":"in","value":["Series A","Series B"]}],"sorts":[{"column":"employee_metrics.latest_count","order":"desc"}],"limit":35}'
```

Structured company search is the wrong choice when:

- the user gave you a known source page
- the target is too fuzzy/conceptual for structured filters
- you need semantic discovery first, not a precise market pull

## Known-source extraction (web and provider APIs)

Use when the value lives on a public page you can fetch directly — VC portfolios, accelerator batches, conference sites, partner directories, SEC/EDGAR, registries, team pages, Reddit threads, LinkedIn/X profiles. Extractive, not discovery.

Rule: if you have the URL, scrape it directly. Use search only to find the URL when the source itself is unknown. Prefer official pages over reconstructed lists. For investor-backed targeting ("companies backed by a16z", "YC W26"), official portfolio pages beat structured search.

Source-type routing:

- **Static HTML pages, registries, official filings** → `curl` or `WebFetch` (free).
- **JS-rendered portfolios, directories, job boards** → `parallel_extract` (~1 cr).
- **LinkedIn profiles, employees, posts, and reactions** → Native HarvestAPI operations. Search and describe the relevant `harvestapi_*` tool before execution.
- **Reddit, X, Similarweb, or a LinkedIn surface HarvestAPI does not expose** → Apify actors. See [`portfolio-prospecting.md`](recipes/portfolio-prospecting.md) for investor/accelerator flow.

Direct extraction example:

```bash
deepline tools execute parallel_extract --payload '{"urls":["https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?batch=W26"],"objective":"Extract all company names, domains, and one-line descriptions from this page","full_content":true}'
```

For LinkedIn, prefer the native HarvestAPI provider: `harvestapi_get_profile` for one profile, `harvestapi_search_leads` for company employees, `harvestapi_get_profile_posts` for a profile's posts, and both `harvestapi_get_post_reactions` and `harvestapi_get_post_comments` for post engagers. Treat these names as starting hints. Tool search is broad and can be noisy, so confirm the exact operation with `deepline tools describe <operation> --schema-only` before execution.

```bash
deepline tools describe harvestapi_get_profile --schema-only
deepline tools execute harvestapi_get_profile --payload '{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/someone/"}' --json
```

Use `--json` for single-object operations such as profile, company, and post
lookups. Use `--out results.csv` for list operations such as employee, post,
reaction, and comment searches; using `--out` on a single-object response can
select an unrelated nested list for CSV preview. For post discovery, prefer a
known `company`, `companyId`, `profile`, or `profileId` filter when available;
broad keyword `search` is fuzzy and can include similarly named terms.

Use Apify for source-specific scraping that HarvestAPI does not cover. Known non-HarvestAPI actors include `supreme_coder/linkedin-post` and `radeance/similarweb-scraper`; discover and inspect the current actor contract before execution.

For LinkedIn URL recovery itself (not scraping after you have the URL), use `URL recovery` below.

## People search at known companies

Use this section when the user already has target companies and needs candidate contacts.

### Resolve missing domains; do not make the user do it

Company names are sufficient input for a known-company task. Before a
domain-scoped contact or enrichment call, resolve the canonical domain for each
named company yourself. Do not interrupt the task with a request for an
"exact," "definitive," or comma-separated domain list.

1. Search the live catalog for a company/domain-resolution or web-search
   capability, then inspect its contract. Use a free or no-credit route for the
   first pass when one is available.
2. Search the company name with any supplied context (location, product,
   investor, LinkedIn URL, or person). Select a candidate only when its official
   page identifies the same organization. Do not use a directory, social
   profile, marketplace, or a search-result host as the company domain.
3. Normalize the resulting hostname, retain the official-page URL as
   `domain_evidence_url`, and carry `company_name`, `domain`, and
   `domain_confidence` into the next stage.
4. If the first route misses, try an independent company-search or web-search
   route before leaving the domain unresolved. Record the attempted routes and
   an explicit `domain_miss_reason`; never guess from the spelling of the name.

For a common or ambiguous name, use the context already in the request and
report the candidate and confidence in the normal output. Do not stop to ask
the user to identify a domain unless choosing among live candidates would cause
a material paid or external action. If no candidate can be verified, preserve
that row as unresolved and continue with every other named company.

Recommended course of action:

1. For nuanced roles or real titles at named companies, follow [`recipes/find-qualified-titles.md`](recipes/find-qualified-titles.md): `company_titles` -> qualify exact roster titles -> `deepline_native_search_contact` with `title_lists`.
2. Use `exa_people_search` after the roster/database pass to fill public-profile gaps.
3. Use `dropleads_search_people` afterward to add supplemental database rows or contact data.
4. Use broad function keywords plus seniority when no roster exists or the user wants broad audience sizing.
5. Prefer company domains over company names when you know them.
6. Stop at candidate contacts here. If the task becomes "fill in emails or enrich these rows", hand off to `enriching-and-researching.md`.

### Broad audience search and sizing

DropLeads remains useful when the user wants a segment count, a broad sample, or
coverage beyond the roster-qualified results. It is not the primary path for nuanced
titles at a named company because keyword filters can miss titles such as "Director,
Mount Sinai AI Assurance Lab."

```bash
deepline tools execute dropleads_search_people --payload '{"filters":{"companyDomains":["stripe.com"],"jobTitles":["Growth","Sales","Revenue"],"seniority":["VP","Director"],"personalCountries":{"include":["United States"]}},"pagination":{"page":1,"limit":5}}'
```

### Count-first people search

```bash
deepline tools execute dropleads_search_people --payload '{"filters":{"jobTitles":["Marketing"],"seniority":["VP","Director"],"personalCountries":{"include":["United States"]}},"pagination":{"page":1,"limit":1}}'
```

### Tiny-startup fallback

exa_people_search returns keyword-matched LinkedIn profiles, not verified employees. For startups <50 people, check each title for the correct company; if >30% are unaffiliated, switch to `deeplineagent`.

**Disambiguate common company names.** For names like "Ergo", "Bloom", or "Newton", add accelerator batch, domain, or product context so Exa does not return unrelated companies.

```bash
# Bad — "Ergo" matches ERGO Direkt AG, ErgoPack, THE ERGO CORP, etc.
deepline tools execute exa_people_search --payload '{"query":"GTM engineer at Ergo","numResults":5}'

# Good — YC batch + domain disambiguates
deepline tools execute exa_people_search --payload '{"query":"GTM engineer at Ergo joinergo.com YC W25","company_name":"Ergo","numResults":5}'
```

Use `company_name` to pass the target company as structured input — it appends to the query if not already present and tags the response meta for downstream validation.

## Role-based contact search

**Do not guess exact job titles for broad people-search filters.** Titles vary wildly across companies, especially startups, so guessed exact-match filters miss adjacent real titles.

- **Bad:** `jobTitles: ["Head of Growth", "VP RevOps", "GTM Engineer"]` — misses "Director of Growth Marketing", "Revenue Operations Lead", etc.
- **Good:** `jobTitles: ["Growth"]` + `seniority: ["VP", "Director"]` — catches all growth-related senior roles via fuzzy matching.
- **Best for known companies:** obtain verbatim titles from `company_titles`, qualify that roster, then pass the selected exact strings through `title_lists`.

For broad searches without a roster, use 1-2 function keywords (Growth, Sales, Revenue, Security, Fraud, Identity, RevOps, Marketing) plus seniority. This works across DropLeads and CrustData.

For <500-employee companies, narrow title filters often return 0; use broad keyword + seniority. Dropleads has near-zero coverage for <50-emp startups — switch to `exa_people_search` (see Tiny-startup fallback above).

## Hiring-qualified search

Use this section when the user wants companies that are actively hiring for a specific role or likely need a specific function.

Recommended course of action:

1. Discover the plausible company set first. If companies come from a known portfolio or accelerator (YC, a16z, etc.), extract the portfolio first via `Known-source extraction` — you'll get domains for free and skip domain-resolution.
2. Then qualify that set with hiring evidence.
3. Use public-job or semantic evidence only when structured hiring coverage is thin.
4. Treat hiring as a qualification layer, not the only discovery step.

### Structured hiring evidence for known companies

```bash
deepline tools execute crustdata_v2_job_search --payload '{"filters":{"op":"and","conditions":[{"field":"company.basic_info.primary_domain","type":"in","value":["stripe.com","persona.id","sardine.ai"]}]},"limit":100}'
```

### Public hiring evidence

```bash
deepline tools execute exa_search --payload '{"query":"site:ycombinator.com \"GTM engineer\"","numResults":20,"type":"auto"}'
```

## URL recovery

Use this section when you already know the company or person identity and need the URL.

Recommended course of action:

1. Use a highly specific query.
2. Include company and role context for people.
3. Leave null when the identity is not specific enough.
4. Only move to scraping once you already have the correct URL.

### Company LinkedIn URL lookup

```bash
deepline tools execute serper_google_search --payload '{"query":"\"OpenAI\" site:linkedin.com/company","num":3}'
```

### Person LinkedIn URL lookup

```bash
deepline tools execute serper_google_search --payload '{"query":"\"Jane Smith\" \"Acme\" \"sales ops\" site:linkedin.com/in","num":5}'
```

## Sample calls by provider

### Serper Google Search

Use `site:` plus quoted phrases for precision. Keyword soup without `site:` is noisy.

```bash
# YC job listings for a specific role
deepline tools execute serper_google_search --payload '{"query":"site:ycombinator.com \"GTM engineer\" \"Series B\"","num":10}'

# Company LinkedIn URL discovery
deepline tools execute serper_google_search --payload '{"query":"\"OpenAI\" site:linkedin.com/company","num":3}'
```

### CrustData (company + person search, autocomplete)

**Always read `src/lib/integrations/crustdata/` before building filter payloads.** Field names, enums, and operators are non-obvious.

**Key rules:** autocomplete unknown canonical values; use `employee_count_range` for headcount filters and `employee_metrics.latest_count` only for sorts; `hq_country` uses ISO 3-letter codes; prefer `crunchbase_categories` for niche verticals; extract returned firmographics directly; use `employee_metrics.growth_6m_percent` before paid job search.

**Operators**: `(.)` = fuzzy contains (default), `[.]` = substring, `=`, `!=`, `in`, `not_in`, `>`, `<`, `=>`, `=<`.

```bash
# Always autocomplete first — compare crunchbase_categories vs linkedin_industries for your vertical
deepline tools execute crustdata_companydb_autocomplete --payload '{"field":"crunchbase_categories","query":"fraud","limit":5}'
deepline tools execute crustdata_companydb_autocomplete --payload '{"field":"linkedin_industries","query":"financial","limit":5}'
```

```bash
# Use crunchbase_categories for niche verticals, hq_country with ISO codes
deepline tools execute crustdata_companydb_search --payload '{"filters":[{"filter_type":"crunchbase_categories","type":"in","value":["Fraud Detection","Identity Management"]},{"filter_type":"hq_country","type":"=","value":"USA"},{"filter_type":"employee_count_range","type":"in","value":["51-200","201-500"]},{"filter_type":"last_funding_round_type","type":"in","value":["Series A","Series B"]}],"sorts":[{"column":"employee_metrics.latest_count","order":"desc"}],"limit":50}'
```

### People Data Labs

**PDL is expensive -- use it as a last resort.** Exhaust Exa, Google, and Crustdata first.

**Shell quoting with PDL SQL:** PDL takes a raw SQL string. Avoid inline single-quote escaping in bash -- it breaks silently. Instead write the payload to a temp file and pass it with `--payload-file`, or use a bash heredoc:

```bash
PAYLOAD=$(cat <<'EOF'
{"sql": "SELECT * FROM company WHERE industry = 'financial services' AND location.country = 'united states' AND size IN ('51-200','201-500') AND latest_funding_stage IN ('series_a','series_b')", "size": 20}
EOF
)
deepline tools execute peopledatalabs_company_search --payload "$PAYLOAD"
```

### Exa (search, answer, research)

Exa is a semantic web index -- it finds pages by meaning, not just keywords.

**Query rules:** Write natural-language descriptions, not keyword soup (`"B2B SaaS companies that sell sales automation tools"` not `"SaaS B2B sales tools 2025"`). Use `type: "neural"` (default) for concept-driven queries, `"deep"` with `additionalQueries` for broad coverage. Use `startPublishedDate`/`endPublishedDate` for recency. Use `contents.summary` for per-result LLM summaries, `contents.highlights` for snippets.

**Critical: `category` vs `includeDomains` -- NOT interchangeable:**

- `category: "company"` / `"people"` uses Exa's entity index. **`includeDomains`, `excludeDomains`, `includeText`, `excludeText` are NOT supported with `category`** -- throws an error. Use for "companies that _are_ X" (concept-driven), NOT "companies that _have_ X" (attribute-based).
- `includeDomains` / `excludeDomains` -- scope a regular web search (no category) to specific sites.

**"Companies that hire X role" -- use `includeDomains` on job boards, NOT `category:"company"`:**

```bash
deepline tools execute exa_search --payload '{"query":"GTM engineer job opening at Y Combinator startup","numResults":15,"type":"neural","includeDomains":["ycombinator.com"],"contents":{"highlights":{"numSentences":2,"highlightsPerUrl":1}}}'
```

**Tool selection:** `exa_search` (general-purpose, start here), `exa_company_search` (category:"company" shorthand), `exa_people_search` (structured person entities, best as a play column), `exa_answer` (fact-checking only, low recall), `exa_research` (deep multi-source, supports `outputSchema`).

```bash
# Concept-based company search (category OK here)
deepline tools execute exa_search --payload '{"query":"B2B SaaS companies building AI-powered sales tools","category":"company","numResults":10,"type":"neural","contents":{"summary":{"query":"What does this company do and what funding stage are they?"}}}'

# Attribute + domain-scoped search (NO category -- use includeDomains instead)
deepline tools execute exa_search --payload '{"query":"Series B fintech startups in New York","type":"neural","additionalQueries":["fintech companies Series B NYC"],"numResults":20,"includeDomains":["techcrunch.com","crunchbase.com"],"startPublishedDate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","contents":{"summary":{"query":"What does this company do and what stage are they?"}}}'
```

### Parallel (managed research)

Good for broad discovery when you don't know which domains hold the data. Lower precision than domain-scoped Exa/Google but finds things others miss. Set `max_chars_total` > 10000 for 5+ results.

```bash
deepline tools execute parallel_search --payload '{"mode":"agentic","objective":"Find recent hiring and launch signals for OpenAI","max_results":5,"excerpts":{"max_chars_per_result":1200,"max_chars_total":12000}}'
```

## At-scale coverage completion

Use this section when the job is coverage completion -- you already have target accounts/segments and need to backfill missing contacts/emails.

### Count-capable providers (verified)

Use these when you want fast sizing before doing the full list pull.

| Provider         | Tool                                 | Command                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Notes: Some providers need an actual page pull (small `limit`/`per_page`) instead of dedicated count tools. CrustData `companydb_search`/`persondb_search` don't surface reliable totals -- use for retrieval, not sizing. Always compare `total_count`/`total` with your filter set and stop early when a slice suffices.

### Company-first sourcing

```bash
# Size first
deepline tools execute dropleads_get_lead_count \
  --payload '{
    "filters": {
      "keywords": ["technology"],
      "employeeRanges": ["51-200"]
    }
  }'

# Pull list (100 per page)
deepline tools execute dropleads_search_people \
  --payload '{
    "filters": {
      "keywords": ["technology"],
      "employeeRanges": ["51-200"]
    },
    "pagination": {"page": 1, "limit": 100}
  }'
```

### Contact-first sourcing

```bash
deepline tools execute dropleads_search_people \
  --payload '{"filters":{"jobTitles":["VP Sales","CRO"],"employeeRanges":["51-200","201-500"],"keywords":["technology"],"personalCountries":{"include":["United States"]}},"pagination":{"page":1,"limit":100}}'
```

### Signal prioritization

Don't outreach the full list. Use `niche-signal-discovery` skill if you have won/lost data. Otherwise enrich with `crustdata_v2_job_search` (hiring), `exa_search` w/ `includeDomains`+`contents` (website/pain language), then score.
