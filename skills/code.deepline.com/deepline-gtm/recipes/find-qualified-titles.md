# Find Qualified Titles (company_titles -> ICP filter -> contacts)

Given a list of companies and an ICP described in plain English, find the people who
hold the matching roles - starting from each company's **real title roster**, not
keyword guesses. The title roster is free, the ICP match is one small LLM call per
company, and you only spend on contacts at the very end.

**Why exact-match (`title_lists`) is correct here - not a tradeoff.** Normally exact
title matching is brittle (it misses "Sr Director Marketing Operations" if you typed
"Senior Director..."). That problem does not exist in this pipeline, because the titles
come from `company_titles` - they are the company's _own verbatim roster strings_. The
LLM picks from that list, so every matched title is guaranteed to resolve. `title_lists`
then returns **all exact matches for every title you selected** (it's an OR across the
list, exact per entry): pick 5 titles -> get every person holding any of those 5. This is
the whole payoff of qualifying against the real roster first.

## When to use

- **Primary path** when the user asks for nuanced functions or real job titles at named
  companies, such as "AI leadership at Mount Sinai."
- "Find all job titles at these companies" / "what roles exist at X".
- "Find the marketing ops / RevOps / Salesforce buyers at these accounts."
- "Find qualified titles" - user has accounts + an ICP and wants the real owners of a function.
- Any time you would otherwise guess `title_filters` keyword patterns and miss real titles
  (e.g. "Revenue Architect" instead of "VP Sales", "GTM Systems" instead of "Sales Ops").

Do **not** reach for paid people-search (`peopledatalabs_person_search`,
`crustdata_persondb_search`) for this. `company_titles` answers "what titles exist here"
for free; people-search is for when you already know the persona and need volume.

## Inputs

- A CSV (or just a list) of company domains. `domain` column required;
  `company_name` / `company_linkedin` optional.
- An ICP in plain English (the qualification criteria).

## Why this shape (non-obvious rules, all verified live)

- **`title_lists`, not `title_filters`.** Matched titles are exact strings from the
  company's own roster - `title_lists` does exact, full-string matching and returns every
  holder of each title you pass. `title_filters` is boolean keyword/substring matching
  (e.g. `"operations"` also catches "People Operations Intern") - use that only when you
  did NOT qualify against the real roster first and want a broad keyword sweep.
- **`title_lists` works on `search_contact`, NOT `prospector`.** Verified live:
  `prospector` returns `422 unexpected key 'title_lists'` - its Deepline schema only
  accepts `title_filter`/`title_filters` + `limit`. (Upstream Waterfall once announced
  `title_lists` on Prospector, but Deepline's prospector parser does not wire it through;
  `search_contact` is the path that works today.)
- **`page_size` caps results per call - raise it for big lists.** `search_contact`
  defaults to a small page. If you select many titles or expect many holders, set
  `page_size` high enough (or paginate with `page_number`) so matches aren't silently
  truncated. Don't assume 10 is enough when you passed 30 titles.
- **Materialize nested output into flat columns before referencing it.** In a play,
  row cells, `company_titles` currently appears under `row.titles.output.titles`
  and `deeplineagent` structured JSON under `row.icp_match.result.object.<field>` or
  `row.icp_match.extracted_json.<field>`.
  A bare placeholder like `{{titles.output.titles}}` does NOT resolve, and a raw array
  placeholder breaks a JSON payload spec. Extract with `run_javascript` first.
  Direct `deepline tools execute --json` uses the V2 envelope (`toolResponse.raw...`),
  so do not copy direct execute paths into row-level JS without inspecting the persisted row.
  - Inside `run_javascript`, use the persisted row shape:
    `row.titles.output.titles` and
    `row.icp_match.result.object.matched_titles` / `row.icp_match.extracted_json.matched_titles`.
  - `title_lists[].titles` must be a real array at execution time, not a CSV string
    that looks like JSON. If a CSV-sourced cell still reaches `search_contact` as
    a string like `["VP Sales"]`, Deepline rejects it with a pre-provider `422 value must be
    an array`; that should not bill. Add a `run_javascript` parse/materialize pass
    immediately before `search_contact` when needed.
  - When injecting a live array-valued cell into a later payload, **quote the placeholder**:
    `"titles": "{{matched_titles}}"` (the interpolator substitutes the real array).

## Pipeline

This is a five-column custom play over `companies.csv` — author it once per
[deepline-plays.md](deepline-plays.md) with these columns in order (single-company
probes: run the same tool via `deepline tools execute`):

1. `titles` — `company_titles` with `{"domain": row.domain}` (FREE roster).
2. `titles_flat` — `run_javascript`: `const t = row.titles?.output?.titles || row.titles?.result?.data?.output?.titles || []; return JSON.stringify(t);`
3. `icp_match` — `deeplineagent`, model `openai/gpt-5.4-mini`, prompt: `ICP: <describe the buying-power roles, e.g. Marketing Ops, Sales Ops, RevOps, Salesforce admin/architect; senior IC and above; exclude recruiters/finance/support/plain reps>. From this exact title list return ONLY matching titles as exact strings: ${row.titles_flat}. Return JSON.` with `jsonSchema {matched_titles: string[], reasoning: string}`.
4. `matched_titles` — `run_javascript`: `const match = row.icp_match || {}; const t = match?.extracted_json?.matched_titles || match?.result?.object?.matched_titles || match?.object?.matched_titles || []; return JSON.stringify(t.slice(0,100));`
5. `contacts` — `deepline_native_search_contact` with `{"domain": row.domain, "title_lists":[{"name":"icp","titles": <matched_titles array>}], "page_size": 50}`. Returns all exact matches per title (LinkedIn only — email/phone redacted); raise `page_size` when many titles matched.

Contacts land at `contacts.output.persons[]` (legacy rows may use
`contacts.result.data.output.persons[]`) with name, title, `linkedin_url`, seniority,
and department. Flatten to one row per contact before any email or phone reveal:

```bash
python3 .skills/deepline-gtm/scripts/flatten-search-contact-persons.py contacts.csv \
  --contacts-col contacts > contact_rows.csv
```

If the skill is installed outside the repo, use the same script from the installed
`deepline-gtm/scripts/` directory. This expansion is a file-level step, not another
`run_javascript` column, because one company can produce many people.

## Tiered contact reveal - buy only what the user needs

Step 3 (`search_contact`) returns LinkedIn only - the lowest upfront cost. **Ask the user
which channels they actually need before spending**, then add only the steps they pick:

| Tier          | Tool                                                                               | Returns                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| LinkedIn only | `search_contact` (above)                                                           | name, title, LinkedIn (email/phone redacted) |
| + work email  | `enrich_contact` on the kept `linkedin_url` (or `first_name`+`last_name`+`domain`) | + verified email                             |
| + phone       | `enrich_phone` on priority contacts only                                           | + phone (top picks only)                     |

Run email/phone only on the rows the user keeps; never blanket-enrich the full set.

Cost note: if the user wants emails on _most_ contacts up front, `prospector` (boolean
`title_filters`, returns contact+verified email in one call) can be cheaper net than
`search_contact` + a separate `enrich_contact` per row - but `prospector` does **not**
support exact `title_lists`, so you lose the roster-exact precision. Use `search_contact`
when you want exact-title precision and LinkedIn-first; consider `prospector` only when
broad boolean matching is acceptable and you want emails in one shot.

## Supplemental coverage after the roster path

Run supplemental providers only after the roster-qualified `search_contact` pass:

- `exa_people_search` can find public web/profile entities missing from contact
  databases. Verify the current employer and title before treating a result as a match.
- `dropleads_search_people` can add database rows or contact data, but keep it
  supplemental for nuanced titles. Its keyword filters can miss a real roster title
  such as "Director, Mount Sinai AI Assurance Lab" when the guessed keywords do not
  occur in the title.

For broad market sizing rather than named-company title qualification,
`dropleads_get_lead_count` and `dropleads_search_people` remain appropriate primary
tools.

## Notes

- Don't pre-trim the roster before the LLM filter - let the LLM pick from the full list,
  then raise `page_size` on step 3 so all holders of the matched titles come back.
- The LLM filter is only as good as the ICP prompt - be specific about include/exclude,
  and tell it to return **exact strings from the list** so titles map back to `title_lists`.
- v2 SDK equivalent: `docs-examples/sdk-v2/companies-to-contacts-icp-titles.play.ts`.
