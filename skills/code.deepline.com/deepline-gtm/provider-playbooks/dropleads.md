# Dropleads Playbook

Use Dropleads as a two-phase flow: low-cost contact discovery first, paid enrichment second. Do not use Dropleads people search as the first step for account discovery.

## 1) Start with low-cost discovery

- Use `dropleads_get_lead_count` to size the audience before any paid call.
- Use `dropleads_search_people` to inspect masked contacts and validate ICP filters (free).
- Use `dropleads_search_people` after you already have target account domains, by passing `filters.companyDomains`. It is a contact search primitive, not a dependable way to discover target accounts.
- Do not build joins or account-discovery flows that depend on every returned lead having `companyDomain`. Treat returned `companyDomain` as optional; if you need account domains as the source of truth, use a company-native search/enrichment tool first.
- Tighten filters until sample rows clearly match role, industry, and geo expectations.
- Key filter fields: `filters.jobTitles`, `filters.seniority` (VP/Director/Manager/Senior/Entry/Intern), `filters.industries`, `filters.departments`, `filters.companyDomains`, `filters.employeeRanges`, `filters.personalCountries`, `filters.personalStates`, `filters.personalCities`, `filters.organizationCountries`, `filters.organizationStates`, `filters.organizationCities`, `pagination.page`, `pagination.limit`. Use `personal*` for the contact's location and `organization*` for company HQ; a person's location is not necessarily their employer's HQ. Use title terms like `CEO`, `CTO`, or `Founder` for C-level searches; do not pass `C-Level` as a Dropleads seniority value — Dropleads' own API docs list it, but live validation rejects it. `filters.seniorityExclude` and `filters.departmentsExclude` take the same exact values as their include twins.

### Filter best practices

All Dropleads filters nest under the `filters` object. Pagination nests under `pagination`. The canonical payload shape:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "companyDomains": ["microsoft.com"],
    "jobTitles": ["CTO", "VP Engineering"],
    "seniority": ["VP", "Director"],
    "personalCountries": { "include": ["United States"] }
  },
  "pagination": { "page": 1, "limit": 25 }
}
```

**Quick reference — correct filter keys:**

| Filter      | Correct key                                                                                 | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Company     | `filters.companyDomains`                                                                    | Exact domain match for known accounts. Prefer this when you already have domains; do not rely on people-search results to discover a complete account-domain list. `companyNames` does fuzzy substring matching — "Microsoft" pulls in unrelated businesses. |
| Person geo  | `filters.personalCountries`, `filters.personalStates`, `filters.personalCities`             | Filters the contact's location. Each field uses an `{ "include": [...], "exclude": [...] }` object.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Company geo | `filters.organizationCountries`, `filters.organizationStates`, `filters.organizationCities` | Filters the company HQ, not the contact's location. Each field uses an `{ "include": [...], "exclude": [...] }` object.                                                                                                                                      |
| Seniority   | `filters.seniority`, `filters.seniorityExclude`                                             | Exact values only: `VP`, `Director`, `Manager`, `Senior`, `Entry`, `Intern`. Use `jobTitles` terms like `CEO`, `CTO`, or `Founder` for C-level searches.                                                                                                     |
| Department  | `filters.departments`, `filters.departmentsExclude`                                         | Exact values only: `Engineering`, `Sales`, `Marketing`, `Operations`, `Finance`, `HR`, `Product`, `Customer Success`, `Legal`, `IT`.                                                                                                                         |

Pilot with a broad search first when unsure.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Exclude filters use the same vocabulary as their include twin

`seniorityExclude` and `departmentsExclude` take the exact same values as `seniority` and `departments`. Prime-DB itself silently ignores an unrecognized value in either exclude list: the exclusion you asked for never happens, the call still returns 200, and the result set still shifts because the filter key is present. Deepline rejects unknown values with a 422 instead of letting a wrong answer look like a valid one.

Also note that sending `seniorityExclude` at all drops leads that carry no seniority in Prime-DB, so it narrows results beyond the levels you name. On a `sephora.com` sample: 1514 leads with no seniority filter, 1058 with all six levels included, 94 with all six excluded.

### Geo filters are best-effort, not verified

Dropleads geo filters (`personalCountries` / `personalStates` / `personalCities` and `organizationCountries` / `organizationStates` / `organizationCities`) match against **self-reported, LinkedIn-sourced location text** — they are not verified against the contact's actual location. Treat them accordingly:

- **City-level is the loosest match and leaks.** `personalCities` can return contacts whose stated city loosely matches even when their real location differs, and non-US contacts can appear under a US-city filter (e.g. a Bulgarian contact surfacing under `personalCities: San Francisco` + `personalCountries: United States`). Country/state are more reliable.
- **Person vs. company location are different fields.** `personal*` filters the contact's own location; `organization*` filters the company HQ. Don't conflate them — filtering a remote employee by company HQ city (or vice versa) drops or leaks legitimate matches.
- **Verify geo when precision matters.** Combine `personalCountries`/`personalStates` with `personalCities`, then post-filter the returned leads on their `country`/`state`/`city` (and exclude obvious mismatches) before trusting the result or spending on enrichment. Do not assume the filter alone guarantees the geo.

## 2) Escalate paid calls only for shortlisted targets

- Run `dropleads_email_finder` for contacts that passed the discovery pass.
- Run `dropleads_mobile_finder` only when phone is required for the workflow.
- Keep pilots small first, then scale after quality checks pass.

## 3) Gate outbound with verifier status

- Treat `invalid`, `catch_all`, and `unknown` as non-send by default.
- Treat `valid` as the only status that passes automatic send gates.
- Respect `credits_charged` in responses for post-execution billing accuracy.

## 4) Practical sequencing

1. Count segment (`dropleads_get_lead_count`).
2. Sample segment (`dropleads_search_people`).
3. Pre-score titles with `run_javascript` if looking for a specific profile (e.g. founders, GTM engineers).
4. Retrieve LinkedIn profiles with `harvestapi_get_profile` for structured work history and signals. Use Apify only when native HarvestAPI does not expose the required LinkedIn shape.
5. Extract signals with `run_javascript` from the structured HarvestAPI output (e.g. founder detection, hiring signals).
6. Enrich emails via waterfall (`dropleads_email_finder` first, then other providers).
7. Verify candidate emails (`dropleads_email_verifier` or `leadmagic_email_validation`).
8. Expand only after pilot quality is confirmed.

## 5) Account discovery boundary

For account-based pipelines, start with a company-native source that returns account domains as first-class results. Feed those domains into Dropleads via `filters.companyDomains` to find contacts at known accounts. Dropleads may include `companyDomain` on returned people, but it is not guaranteed enough to be the join key that creates the account universe.
