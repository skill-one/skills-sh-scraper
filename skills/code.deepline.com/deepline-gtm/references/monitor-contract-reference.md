# Monitor Contract Reference

This factual reference is generated from the same monitor capability contracts used by validation and the live `tools get` / `monitors available` surfaces. Keep rationale and workflows in hand-written guides.

## Shared lifecycle

- monitors check validates a definition locally and does not deploy, spend credits, or prove a future event will arrive.
- monitors deploy is a full desired definition. Use deploy --dry-run to inspect provider and Deepline-credit effects; use monitors update for a patch.
- monitors get returns the stored deployed definition plus monitor_spec, whose fields list the deployable payload paths, descriptions, constraints, and provider-specific semantics for that monitor type.

## Shared errors

- Validation errors name the payload path and expected contract value; correct the definition and rerun monitors check.
- A paused monitor needs a balance or entitlement correction before reactivation. Deepline exposes Deepline pricing only.

#### Fields

| Field | Semantics |
| --- | --- |
| `job_titles` | Provider-facing title expression. Deepline validates its grammar and forwards it unchanged; it overrides departments and seniorities when present. Stored readback does not prove upstream matching or billing semantics. |
| ↳ applies | Only company_new_hires, company_job_openings, company_promotions, and company_social_posts_cxo. |
| ↳ precedence | job_titles overrides departments and seniorities. |
| ↳ grammar | Double-quoted title terms joined with uppercase AND, OR, and NOT. Parentheses are not part of the documented grammar. |
| ↳ grammar example | `"VP" OR "Head of Sales"` |
| `departments` | Persona department filter. |
| ↳ applies | Only company_new_hires, company_job_openings, company_promotions, and company_social_posts_cxo; ignored when job_titles is present. |
| `seniorities` | Persona seniority filter. |
| ↳ applies | Only company_new_hires, company_job_openings, company_promotions, and company_social_posts_cxo; ignored when job_titles is present. |
| `updates_since` | Permanent historical eligibility boundary for a new radar, not a query-time date filter. |
| ↳ grammar | RFC3339 timestamp with Z or a numeric UTC offset; now or earlier and within five calendar years. |

#### Pricing, identity, and updates

- Pricing: Deepline pricing is selected by radar_type and returned by the live monitor contract. Provider spend is not exposed.
- Identity: One Deepline monitor identity is radar_type plus domain per organization.
- Update: A filter change replaces the upstream radar under the same Deepline monitor key and retains Customer DB rows.
- Backfill: Historical matching can arrive during the first 24 hours. A filter update does not request historical findings that would newly match.

#### Troubleshooting

- **job_titles is rejected:** Use "VP" OR "Head of Sales"; operators must be uppercase.
