# Safety & Access Control Reference

Comprehensive safety guidance for building agents and integrations with the Bankr API and CLI. Covers wallet-level security settings, API key access controls, wallet separation, rate limits, and operational best practices.

Bankr has two independent layers of safety controls: **wallet-level** (configured at [bankr.bot](https://bankr.bot) → Security; applies to every surface) and **per-API-key** (configured at [bankr.bot/api-keys](https://bankr.bot/api-keys); applies to one key). Both run independently — a transaction must satisfy both to broadcast.

## Wallet-Level Security Settings

User-controlled wallet safety features configured at [bankr.bot](https://bankr.bot) → Security. These apply to every surface — chat, agent, API, CLI — because they are enforced at the transaction broadcast chokepoint. Modifying them requires web (Privy) authentication; an API key cannot change them.

### Controls

| Control | Default | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Pause all transactions | Off | Blocks every outbound transaction until unpaused |
| Daily spending limit | $500 / 24h | Rejects any tx that pushes rolling-24h USD outflow past the limit |
| Per-transaction limit | $500 | Rejects any single tx priced above the limit |
| Price impact limit | On (15%) | Rejects a swap whose estimated price impact exceeds the limit |
| Permitted recipients | Off | Restricts transfers/swaps to an allowlist; new entries enter a configurable cooldown |
| Arbitrary contract calls | Off (blocked) | While off, blocks `write_contract`, raw `/wallet/submit`, and arbitrary transaction tools (named operations like swaps still work). Enabling is a timed opt-in |
| Response channels | All on | Per-channel control over where the agent may reply — X, Farcaster, Telegram. A disabled channel is skipped silently |

USD limits accept `1` to `1,000,000`. Setting `0` is rejected — disable the limit instead. Cooldown accepts `0` to `168` hours (default 24h).

### Defaults Are Enforced, Everywhere

A wallet that has never opened the Security page still has a **$500 daily and $500 per-transaction limit**, and those defaults are enforced on every signing path — including the ones that don't run the agent's preflight: **x402 paid calls**, **raw `/wallet/submit`**, and direct signer callers. Don't design an integration around the idea that an unconfigured wallet is uncapped; if it needs to sign above $500, raise the limit deliberately.

(System-owned vesting wallets are the one exception — they have no Security screen and no user to configure them, and are governed by their signing policy's authorized-caller gate instead.)

### Timed Windows (auto-restoring)

Most controls can be turned off for a bounded window instead of indefinitely, after which they restore themselves. Supported on the **daily limit**, **per-transaction limit**, **price impact limit**, **arbitrary contract calls**, and each **response channel**. Durations are a fixed vocabulary: **10, 30, 60, or 1440 minutes**.

| Property | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| Direction | A deadline only ever resolves toward the **safer** state. On a protection the timer runs while it is *off* and restores it at the deadline; on arbitrary contract calls the framing inverts — the timer runs while calls are *enabled* and revokes them. Neither can turn an enabled protection off, or hold one off past its deadline. |
| Resolution | Read-time, not swept. An expired window is already in effect at the next transaction evaluation — there is no window to race. |
| Replacement | Every explicit write replaces the timer. Toggling a control or editing its amount clears any running window, so a stale off-window can't outlive an edit you thought was unrelated. |
| Authority | The deadline is computed server-side from the duration you choose. A client-supplied timestamp is rejected, and a duration is only accepted on the write direction that starts a timer. |

`/user` and `/user/security` expose the resolved state, so an API key can *read* whether a protection is currently off and when it returns — but not change it. Long-running integrations should re-read rather than cache what they saw at startup: "the limit is off" is a fact with an expiry attached.

### Price Impact Limit

Enabled by default at **15%**, adjustable from **1% to 100%** or turned off on the Security page. Before a swap is signed, Bankr estimates its price impact (how far the trade moves the pool price) and rejects it when the estimate exceeds the limit — this protects against catastrophic fills on thin or low-liquidity pools while leaving normal trading (well under the threshold) untouched. The guard applies to user-initiated swaps across chains; when impact can't be estimated it fails open, and slippage plus minimum-received bounds still protect the fill.

The check runs against the **fee-exclusive** pool impact, not the display estimate — over the Wallet API that's the quote's `swapImpactBps` (`priceImpactBps` is the display figure, which folds in token taxes). Your configured ceiling comes back on the quote as `maxPriceImpactBps` (`null` when protection is off), so you can decide before spending an execution call.

Distinguish the two rejections you can get: a **`400`** is the venue refusing the trade because the pool can't absorb it (retry smaller); a **`403`** is your own price-impact protection rejecting the fresh execution quote. The `403` is not an auth or location failure.

**One venue fails closed rather than open.** A brand-new Solana token still on its Raydium LaunchLab bonding curve exposes no impact figure at all, so it can't be checked against your limit. Rather than fill an unguardable venue, Bankr refuses and surfaces a clean no-route — so with price-impact protection enabled, those bonding-curve fallback swaps are rejected by design. Turn the limit off if you need them; the `minBuyAmount` floor still applies inside the fill.

### Pricing & Fail-Closed Behavior

Bankr prices each transaction at submission time using on-chain quotes (0x for EVM, Jupiter for Solana). If pricing is unavailable and a USD limit is enabled, the transaction is **rejected** rather than waved through. Disable the limit if you need to proceed unpriced.

### Recipient Cooldown

Newly-added entries on the permitted-recipients list wait the configured cooldown (default 24h) before they're usable. Re-adding a previously-removed recipient restarts the cooldown. Your own EVM and Solana addresses are always implicitly allowed.

### Spend Tracking

Successful transactions are recorded in a per-wallet spend log, idempotent on transaction hash, so retries can't inflate the daily counter.

### Relationship to API-Key Controls

The wallet-level permitted-recipients list is independent from the API-key `allowedRecipients`. When both are configured, both must pass:

- **API-key allowlist** = where this key is allowed to send
- **Wallet allowlist** = where this wallet is allowed to send, regardless of key

### Allowlists Disable Uncontrolled-Counterparty Operations

Some operations pay an address that can't be meaningfully checked against an allowlist — a marketplace escrow, a mint contract, a prediction-market exchange. Rather than let those slip past a restriction the operator deliberately configured, Bankr **refuses them outright** whenever the key carries a non-empty `allowedRecipients` list (EVM or Solana):

- **Polymarket** — buying and selling shares
- **NFTs** — purchases, Seadrop and Manifold mints, listing for sale, accepting offers, creating collection offers
- **Airdrops** — both the general airdrop tool and the top-members variant

The error names the action and points at the key administrator; it is not a transient failure and retrying won't help. Swaps and transfers are unaffected — their recipient *is* checkable, and the allowlist gates them normally.

If an agent needs these operations, give it a key **without** a recipient allowlist and constrain it with spend limits, read-only scoping, or IP whitelisting instead. Trying to have both is the case this rule exists to refuse.

### Incident Response

If you suspect a key is compromised:

1. **Pause** the wallet at [bankr.bot](https://bankr.bot) → Security. Halts every outbound transaction immediately, including in-flight broadcasts. Revoking the key alone does not stop transactions already past auth.
2. **Revoke** the key at [bankr.bot/api-keys](https://bankr.bot/api-keys).
3. **Rotate** — generate a new key with the same access profile and update deployments.
4. **Audit** — review recent transactions and agent job history before unpausing.

## API Key Types & Separation

Bankr uses a single key format (`bk_...`) with **capability flags** that control what each key can access. You can optionally configure a separate key for the LLM Gateway.

### Capability Flags

Each API key has independent toggles managed at [bankr.bot/api-keys](https://bankr.bot/api-keys):

| Flag | Controls Access To | Default |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| `walletApiEnabled` | `/wallet/*` endpoints: swap, swap-quote, transfer, sign, submit | true |
| `agentApiEnabled` | `/agent/*` AI endpoints (prompt, job status, profile) | false |
| `tokenLaunchApiEnabled` | Token deployment (`/token-launches/deploy`) and agent deploy tool | true |
| `llmGatewayEnabled` | LLM Gateway at `llm.bankr.bot` (chat completions, model access) | false |
| `readOnly` | When true, restricts Wallet/Agent API to read-only tools | true |

A single key can have multiple capabilities enabled (e.g., both Agent API and LLM Gateway).

### Agent API Key vs LLM Gateway Key

For most users, **one key works for both** the Agent API and LLM Gateway. However, you can configure a separate LLM key when you want different permissions or rate limits for each:

| Config | Agent API Key | LLM Gateway Key |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Environment variable | `BANKR_API_KEY` | `BANKR_LLM_KEY` (falls back to `BANKR_API_KEY`) |
| CLI config key | `apiKey` | `llmKey` (falls back to `apiKey`) |
| Used by | `bankr agent`, `/agent/*` endpoints | `bankr llm claude`, `llm.bankr.bot` |

**When to use separate keys:**
- Your agent API key is read-only but your LLM key needs no such restriction (LLM calls are inherently read-only)
- You want to revoke LLM access without affecting agent operations (or vice versa)
- Different keys for different team members or environments

**Setting a separate LLM key:**
```bash
bankr login --api-key bk_AGENT_KEY --llm-key bk_LLM_KEY   # during login
bankr config set llmKey bk_LLM_KEY                         # after login
```

For full LLM Gateway setup details, see [llm-gateway.md](llm-gateway.md).

## API Key Access Control

Bankr API keys support granular access control configured at [bankr.bot/api-keys](https://bankr.bot/api-keys). Two key security features: **read-only mode** and **IP whitelisting**.

### Read-Only API Keys

When an API key has `readOnly: true`, all write tools are filtered from the agent session. The agent receives a system directive explaining the restriction and will inform users accordingly.

**Behavior by endpoint:**

| Endpoint | Read-Only Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| `POST /agent/prompt` | Works — but only read tools are available (balances, prices, analytics, portfolio, research) |
| `POST /agent/sign` | Blocked — returns 403 |
| `POST /agent/submit` | Blocked — returns 403 |
| `GET /agent/job/{jobId}` | Works — unaffected |
| `POST /agent/job/{jobId}/cancel` | Works — unaffected |

**403 error responses:**

For `/agent/sign`:
```json
{
  "error": "Read-only API key",
  "message": "This API key has read-only access and cannot sign messages or transactions. Update your API key permissions at https://bankr.bot/api-keys"
}
```

For `/agent/submit`:
```json
{
  "error": "Read-only API key",
  "message": "This API key has read-only access and cannot submit transactions. Update your API key permissions at https://bankr.bot/api-keys"
}
```

**Write tool categories filtered in read-only mode:**

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Swaps | Token buy/sell/swap across all chains |
| Transfers | Send tokens, NFTs |
| NFT Operations | Purchase, mint NFTs |
| Staking | Unstake / redeem operations (BNKR staking is withdraw-only — new deposits are deprecated) |
| Orders | Limit orders, stop losses |
| Token Launches | Deploy ERC20/SPL tokens |
| Leverage | Open/close/modify positions |
| Polymarket | Place/redeem bets |
| Claims | Claim rewards, fees |

The agent receives a system directive and will explain the restriction if a user requests a write operation:

> *"This session has READ-ONLY API access. You can retrieve information (balances, prices, analytics, portfolio data, market research) but CANNOT execute any transactions."*

### IP Whitelisting

API keys support an `allowedIps` whitelist with both individual IPs and CIDR ranges. When configured, requests from non-whitelisted IPs are rejected at the authentication layer before reaching any endpoint.

- **Empty array** (`[]`) = all IPs allowed (default)
- **Non-empty array** = only listed IPs/ranges can use the key
- **CIDR notation** supported (e.g., `10.0.0.0/24`, `192.168.1.0/16`)

**403 error response:**
```json
{
  "error": "IP address not allowed",
  "message": "IP address not allowed for this API key"
}
```

### Configuring Access Control

Manage API key settings at [bankr.bot/api-keys](https://bankr.bot/api-keys):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `readOnly` | boolean | When true, only read tools are available |
| `allowedIps` | string[] | IP/CIDR whitelist (e.g., `["1.2.3.4", "10.0.0.0/24"]`, empty = all allowed) |
| `walletApiEnabled` | boolean | Whether `/wallet/*` write endpoints are accessible |
| `agentApiEnabled` | boolean | Whether `/agent/*` AI endpoints are accessible |
| `tokenLaunchApiEnabled` | boolean | Whether token deployment is accessible |
| `llmGatewayEnabled` | boolean | Whether LLM Gateway endpoints are accessible |

## CLI Security

The Bankr CLI (`@bankr/cli`) stores credentials locally and provides its own safety considerations alongside the REST API.

### Credential Storage

The CLI stores keys in `~/.bankr/config.json`:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "bk_...",
  "llmKey": "bk_...",
  "apiUrl": "https://api.bankr.bot",
  "llmUrl": "https://llm.bankr.bot"
}
```

**Safety rules for CLI credentials:**
- Add `~/.bankr/` to your global `.gitignore` — never commit this directory
- On shared machines, restrict file permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.bankr/config.json`
- Use `bankr logout` to clear stored credentials when done on a shared machine
- For CI/CD, prefer environment variables (`BANKR_API_KEY`, `BANKR_LLM_KEY`) over config files

### Non-Interactive Login

When running the CLI in automated scripts or AI agent environments where interactive prompts aren't possible:

```bash
# Direct key login — no prompts
bankr login --api-key bk_YOUR_KEY

# With separate LLM key
bankr login --api-key bk_AGENT_KEY --llm-key bk_LLM_KEY

# Verify it worked
bankr whoami
```

### CLI vs REST API Access Controls

Access controls (read-only, IP whitelist) apply identically whether you use the CLI or REST API — they are enforced server-side on the API key itself. The CLI is a convenience wrapper; it submits the same requests as direct API calls.

```bash
# These two are equivalent — same access controls apply
bankr agent "What is my balance?"
curl -X POST "https://api.bankr.bot/agent/prompt" \
  -H "X-API-Key: bk_YOUR_KEY" \
  -d '{"prompt": "What is my balance?"}'
```

## Dedicated Agent Wallet

When building autonomous agents that execute transactions, use a **separate Bankr account** as the agent's wallet rather than your personal account. This limits blast radius — if an agent key is compromised or the agent misbehaves, only the dedicated wallet's funds are at risk.

### Why Separate Wallets

- **Limited exposure**: A compromised agent key only exposes the agent wallet's funds, not your main holdings
- **Clear accounting**: Agent transactions are isolated from personal activity
- **Independent controls**: Apply stricter access controls (read-only, IP whitelist) without affecting personal use
- **Easy revocation**: Disable the agent account without disrupting your primary wallet

### Setup Steps

1. **Create a new Bankr account** — Sign up at [bankr.bot/api-keys](https://bankr.bot/api-keys) with a different email. This provisions fresh EVM and Solana wallets automatically.
2. **Generate an API key** — Enable **Agent API** access for the key
3. **Configure access controls** — Set `readOnly`, `allowedIps`, or both as appropriate for your use case
4. **Fund with limited amounts** — Transfer only what the agent needs for its operations

### Recommended Funding

Fund the agent wallet with enough for gas and intended operations, not more:

| Chain | Gas Buffer | Trading Capital |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Base | 0.01 - 0.05 ETH | As needed for trades |
| Polygon | 5 - 10 MATIC | As needed for trades |
| Ethereum | 0.05 - 0.1 ETH | As needed for trades |
| Solana | 0.1 - 0.5 SOL | As needed for trades |

Replenish periodically rather than pre-loading large amounts.

### Access Control Combinations

Choose the right combination based on your agent's purpose:

| Use Case | readOnly | allowedIps | Recipient Allowlist | Wallet Daily Limit |
|----------|----------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Monitoring / analytics bot | Yes | Yes (server IP) | — | — |
| Trading bot (server-side) | No | Yes (server IP) | Yes | Yes ($500–$5,000) |
| Public-facing demo | Yes | No | — | — |
| Development / testing | No | No | No | Yes ($100) |
| Read-only research agent | Yes | No | — | — |

## Rate Limits

### Daily Message Limits

The `/agent/prompt` endpoint enforces daily message limits per account:

| Tier | Daily Limit |
|------|-------------|
| Standard | 100 messages/day |
| Standard + Max Mode | 100 messages/day (Max Mode does not raise the API cap) |
| Bankr Club | 1,000 messages/day |
| Custom | Set per API key |

These are Agent API limits. The web terminal is capped separately at 5 messages/day without a subscription, and unlimited with Bankr Club or Max Mode.

**429 response when limit exceeded:**
```json
{
  "error": "Daily limit exceeded",
  "message": "You have reached your daily API limit of 100 messages. Upgrade to Bankr Club for 1000 messages/day. Resets at 2025-01-15T12:00:00.000Z",
  "resetAt": 1736942400000,
  "limit": 100,
  "used": 100
}
```

The reset window is **24 hours from the first message** (rolling window), not a fixed midnight reset. The `resetAt` field in the response tells you exactly when the counter resets.

### General API Rate Limits

| Scope | Limit | Window |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Public endpoints | 100 requests | 15 minutes per IP |
| General API | 120 requests | 1 minute per IP |
| External orders | 10 requests | 1 second per API key |

For error response handling, retry strategies, and exponential backoff guidance, see [error-handling.md](error-handling.md).

## Transaction Safety

Blockchain transactions are **irreversible** once confirmed. Key safety rules:

- **Test first** — Always test with small amounts before scaling up. Use Base or Polygon for low-cost testing.
- **Verify recipients** — Double-check addresses before transfers. See [transfers.md](transfers.md) for address resolution details.
- **Gas buffer** — Keep enough native tokens for gas on each chain you operate on. See the funding table above for recommended minimums.
- **Wait for confirmation** — Use `waitForConfirmation: true` with `/agent/submit` to ensure transactions are confirmed before proceeding. See [sign-submit-api.md](sign-submit-api.md).
- **Immediate execution** — `/agent/submit` executes transactions immediately with no confirmation prompt. For safety with the prompt API, the AI agent may ask for confirmation on large or unusual operations.
- **Understand calldata** — When using arbitrary transactions, verify the calldata source is trusted. See [arbitrary-transaction.md](arbitrary-transaction.md).
- **Never trade an address you copied out of a balance listing.** Airdropped dust that reports a canonical ticker (`USDG`, `USDC`, `USDT`, `EURC`, a native or wrapped symbol) from the wrong address is a standing attack against agents. Bankr keeps a negative security verdict decisive for that shape, so impostor dust drops out of the portfolio listing instead of reaching the agent as a clean-looking entry — but the durable habit is to name the **ticker** and let Bankr resolve it to the vetted contract. Genuine canonical tokens and tokens you bought through Bankr are never hidden.

## Key Management

### Storage

- **Environment variables** — Store API keys in `BANKR_API_KEY` and LLM keys in `BANKR_LLM_KEY`, never in source code
- **CLI config** — The CLI stores keys in `~/.bankr/config.json`. Ensure this directory is in `.gitignore` and has restricted permissions
- **Never commit secrets** — Add `~/.bankr/`, `.env`, and credential files to `.gitignore`. Use `bankr logout` to clear CLI credentials on shared machines

### Rotation & Revocation

- **Rotate periodically** — Rotate keys via the dashboard at [bankr.bot/api-keys](https://bankr.bot/api-keys) or programmatically via the API key rotation endpoint. Rotation atomically generates a new key and deactivates the old one. After rotating, update both env vars and CLI config (`bankr login --api-key NEW_KEY`)
- **Revoke immediately** — If any key (API or LLM) is leaked, deactivate it immediately at the dashboard
- **One key per purpose** — Use separate keys for different agents, environments, and services (Agent API vs LLM Gateway) so you can revoke individually without disrupting unrelated systems

### Best Practices

- Prefer environment variables for server-side agents and CI/CD; use CLI config for local development
- If you use separate API and LLM keys, rotate them independently
- When revoking a compromised key, check both `BANKR_API_KEY` and `BANKR_LLM_KEY` — if the same key was used for both, both need updating

For the full API key setup and authentication workflow, see [api-workflow.md](api-workflow.md).
