# Token Deployment Reference

Deploy and manage tokens on Base and Robinhood Chain (via Doppler / Uniswap V4) and Solana (via Raydium LaunchLab). Older tokens launched through Clanker remain fully claimable; fee claims auto-detect Doppler vs Clanker.

## Supported Chains

| Chain | Protocol | Token Standard | Best For |
|-------|----------|----------------|----------|
| **Base** (CLI / web default) | Doppler (Uniswap V4) | ERC20 | Memecoins, social/agent tokens |
| **Robinhood Chain** (agent / deploy-API default) | Doppler (Uniswap V4) | ERC20 | Memecoins alongside tokenized stocks |
| **Solana** | Raydium LaunchLab | SPL | High-speed trading, bonding curves |

> **The EVM default differs by surface.** `bankr launch` and the web launch form preselect **Base**; the AI agent and `POST /token-launches/deploy` fall back to **Robinhood Chain** when the request names no chain. Name the chain explicitly whenever it matters.

> **Builder exits:** selling a token you earn creator fees on through Bankr's ordinary swap/limit/stop/DCA/TWAP tools is intentionally restricted (buying and transferring still work). To take profit, builders use a **Glidepath** — a capped, AI-paced gradual sell managed from the token page at [bankr.bot](https://bankr.bot). Glidepath is a web feature, not a CLI/API action. Details: https://docs.bankr.bot/token-launching/glidepath

## Solana Token Launches (Raydium LaunchLab)

Launch SPL tokens on Solana with a bonding curve mechanism that auto-migrates to a Raydium CPMM pool.

### Deployment Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description | Example |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Yes | Token name (1-32 chars) | "MoonRocket" |
| **Symbol** | No | Ticker (1-20 chars), defaults to name | "MOON" |
| **Image** | No | Logo URL | "https://example.com/logo.png" |
| **Decimals** | No | Token decimals (0-9), default 6 | 6 |
| **Fee Recipient** | No | Wallet to receive 99.9% of creator fees | "7xKXtg..." |
| **Cliff Period** | No | Vesting cliff in seconds | 2592000 (30 days) |
| **Unlock Period** | No | Vesting period in seconds | 7776000 (90 days) |
| **Locked Amount** | No | Tokens to lock for vesting | 500000000 |

### Prompt Examples

**Launch tokens:**
- "Launch a token called MOON on Solana"
- "Deploy a Solana memecoin called DOGE2"
- "Launch SpaceRocket with symbol ROCK"
- "Create a token with 30 day cliff and 90 day vesting"
- "Launch BRAIN and route fees to 7xKXtg..."

**Check fees:**
- "How much fees can I claim for MOON?"
- "Check fee status for my token"

**Claim fees:**
- "Claim my fees for MOON" (works for both creator and fee recipient)
- "Claim creator fees for my token"

**Fee Key NFTs:**
- "Show my Fee Key NFTs"
- "What tokens do I have fee rights for?"
- "Transfer fees for MOON to 7xKXtg..."

**Claim shared fee NFT (post-migration):**
- "Claim my fee NFT for ROCKET"

### Bonding Curve Mechanics

1. **Launch**: Token starts with a bonding curve that determines price based on supply
2. **Trading**: Early buyers get lower prices; price increases as more tokens are bought
3. **Migration**: When bonding curve fills, token auto-migrates to Raydium CPMM pool
4. **Post-Migration**: Trading continues on standard AMM with LP fee distribution

**Benefits:**
- Fair launch mechanism (no pre-allocation needed)
- Price discovery through market demand
- Automatic liquidity provision
- No rug pull risk (liquidity is locked)

### Fee Structure

**During Bonding Curve Phase:**
| Fee | Recipient | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| 1% | Bankr Platform | Platform fee |
| 0.5% | Creator | Creator trading fee (or split with fee recipient) |

**Fee Sharing (when feeRecipient specified):**
| Share | Recipient | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 99.9% | Fee Recipient | Main share of creator fees |
| 0.1% | Creator | Referrer fee |

**At Migration (when bonding curve completes):**
| LP Share | Recipient | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 40% | Bankr Platform | Locked platform LP |
| 50% | Token Creator | Locked creator LP (Fee Key NFT) |
| 10% | Burned | Deflationary mechanism |

**Post-Migration:**
- Token trades on Raydium CPMM pool
- Fee Key NFT holders can claim 50% of LP trading fees

### Fee Claiming

**Checking Fee Status:**
- Use "How much fees can I claim for TOKEN?" to check status
- Shows pool status (bonding curve vs migrated)
- Explains how to claim based on your role

**Standard Tokens (No Fee Sharing):**
- Creator claims all 0.5% trading fees
- Use "Claim my fees for TOKEN"
- Requires ~0.005 SOL gas

**Tokens with Fee Sharing Arrangement:**
- BOTH creator AND fee recipient can initiate claims
- Fees automatically split: 99.9% to recipient, 0.1% to creator
- Gas is sponsored by Bankr (free for users)
- Use "Claim my fees for TOKEN" (works for either party)

**Post-Migration Fee Claiming:**
1. Fee recipient claims Fee Key NFT: "Claim my fee NFT for TOKEN"
2. Then claim ongoing LP fees: "Claim CPMM fees for TOKEN"

### Fee Key NFTs

Fee Key NFTs represent the right to claim LP trading fees after migration.

**How They Work:**
- Created when token migrates from bonding curve to CPMM
- Represent 50% share of LP trading fees
- Standard SPL token (decimals=0, amount=1)
- Transferable (with restrictions for permanent arrangements)

**Managing Fee Rights:**
- View your NFTs: "Show my Fee Key NFTs"
- Transfer to another wallet: "Transfer fees for TOKEN to ADDRESS"
- Claim if designated recipient: "Claim my fee NFT for TOKEN"

### Fee Recipient (Permanent Arrangements)

Specify a `feeRecipient` to route creator fees to a different wallet.

**How It Works:**
1. Launch token with `feeRecipient` address
2. During bonding curve: EITHER party can claim fees
3. Fees split automatically: 99.9% to recipient, 0.1% to creator
4. After migration: recipient claims Fee Key NFT
5. Recipient uses "Claim CPMM fees" for ongoing LP fees

**Important:**
- Creates a PERMANENT arrangement
- Deployer CANNOT transfer their Fee Key NFT
- Only the designated recipient can claim the NFT
- Use for treasuries, DAOs, collaborators, or charity

**Who Can Claim During Bonding Curve:**
- Token creator (deployer)
- Designated fee recipient
- Either party initiates, fees split automatically

### Vesting Parameters

Optional vesting for team tokens or investor allocations.

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Cliff Period | Time before any tokens unlock | 30 days = 2592000 seconds |
| Unlock Period | Time for gradual unlock after cliff | 90 days = 7776000 seconds |
| Locked Amount | Total tokens to lock | In token units with decimals |

### Gas Fees

| Operation | Cost | Sponsored? |
|-----------|------|------------|
| Token Launch | ~0.01-0.02 SOL | Yes (within limits) |
| Standard Fee Claim | ~0.005 SOL | No |
| Shared Fee Claim | ~0.005 SOL | Yes (always) |
| Transfer Fee Rights | ~0.005 SOL | No |
| Claim Fee NFT | ~0.005 SOL | No |

Gas is sponsored for token launches within daily limits (1/day standard, 10/day Bankr Club).
Shared fee claims are always sponsored to ensure atomic claim+transfer.

### Rate Limits

| User Type | Daily Limit | Gas Sponsored |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Standard Users | Unlimited | 1 token/day |
| Bankr Club Members | Unlimited | 10 tokens/day |

Users can launch additional tokens beyond sponsored limits by paying ~0.01 SOL gas.

## EVM Token Launches (Base & Robinhood Chain, via Doppler)

Launch ERC20 tokens on Base or Robinhood Chain. New launches create a Uniswap V4 pool via Doppler with a fixed supply and a single swap-fee tier shared between you and the protocol. The default chain differs by surface (see [Supported Chains](#supported-chains)), so name it explicitly — `bankr launch --chain robinhood`, `"chain": "base"`, or "launch a token on robinhood". Robinhood Chain memecoin launches need no location verification — that gate only applies to Robinhood-issued tokenized stocks.

### Token Economics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Supply** | 100 billion on standard launches; fixed and not mintable after deployment. The web launch flow accepts a custom whole-number supply (1 to 100 billion); the deploy API and CLI always launch at the standard 100 billion |
| **Pool** | Uniswap V4 |
| **Pool swap fee** | 0.7% per trade — **95% to the creator** |
| **All-in swap fee** | 1.75% of volume (pool fee + hook-added legs) |

Every trade pays a **0.7% swap fee on the pool, and 95% of it goes to you** — 0.665% of trading volume, paid directly and claimable anytime. On top of that the hook adds the Bankr protocol fee + BNKR buyback and LP fee:

| Recipient | Share of volume |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Creator (you)** — 95% of the 0.7% pool swap fee, claim anytime | **0.665%** |
| **LP fee** (via hook) — a second creator-side fee: compounds as permanently locked liquidity in your own pool, strengthening your token's liquidity on every swap | **0.285%** |
| Bankr protocol fee (via hook) | 0.475% |
| BNKR buyback (via hook) | 0.2375% |
| Protocol (Doppler) | ~0.0875% |

**Fee schedules are fixed at launch and never change retroactively.** Tokens launched before the current structure keep the schedule they launched with: the creator's 95% of the 0.7% pool fee works exactly the same, only the hook add-on differs. Claiming, redirecting, and transferring all behave identically on older tokens.

Fees accumulate in your token and WETH and can be claimed anytime.

### Quote-Only Fees (optional, fixed at launch)

By default creator fees accrue as a mix of the launched token and the quote token (e.g. WETH). At launch you can instead opt into **quote-only fees**, so the entire creator share is collected in the quote token. **Your total take is identical either way** — this is a denomination choice, not a rate change.

| How | Syntax |
|-----|--------|
| Natural language | "launch a token with quote-only fees" |
| CLI | `bankr launch --name MyToken --quote-only-fees` |
| Deploy API | `"quoteOnlyFees": true` |
| Web | toggle in the launch form |

Two knock-on effects for anyone integrating against a quote-only token:

- **Claiming** — the creator's fee entry lives on the **hook contract's** fees manager rather than the pool initializer, and the whole claim arrives in the quote token with no launched-token leg. The claim APIs resolve the right contract automatically.
- **Transferring fee rights** — a direct on-chain `updateBeneficiary` call must target the hook address, not the initializer. The Bankr transfer endpoints resolve this for you either way.

Like the fee schedule, this option cannot be changed after launch.

### Base Quote Tokens (optional, fixed at launch)

Base launches can quote the new token's pool in **BNKR** or **ba3Pump** instead of WETH. ba3Pump is Bankr-bridged PUMP from Solana. Pass `chain: "base"` together with one of the fixed allowlisted addresses:

| Quote token | `pairedTokenAddress` |
|-------------|----------------------|
| BNKR | `0x22af33fe49fd1fa80c7149773dde5890d3c76f3b` |
| ba3Pump | `0x5577a294ae5a21446a11b0e4100ca83803995720` |

- **User-key launches only** — not available on org Partner Key deploys.
- **Mutually exclusive with `pairedStockAddress`.** Sending both is rejected; omit both to get WETH.
- The allowlist is fixed — an arbitrary ERC-20 is not accepted as a quote token.
- Volume in a BNKR- or ba3Pump-quoted pool remains eligible for the weekly developer rebate under the same rules as a WETH-quoted launch.
- Everything else — supply, the fee schedule, creator vesting, quote-only fees, degen mode — behaves exactly as on a WETH launch. "Quote token" here just names the pool's other side.

### Degen Mode (optional, fixed at launch)

Degen mode starts the token at a **$2,500 market cap** instead of the standard starting cap, so the curve's early range is far more volatile. Everything else about the launch — supply, fee schedule, curve shape, vesting — is unchanged.

| How | Syntax |
|-----|--------|
| Natural language | "launch MOON in degen mode" |
| Deploy API | `"degenMode": true` |
| Web | toggle in the launch form |

- **Explicit opt-in only.** You have to ask for the mode by name. A token *called* DEGEN, or generic "make it risky" phrasing, does not turn it on.
- **The figure is fixed at $2,500.** There is no custom starting market cap to request.
- **Not available on partner deploys** — those are rejected with a `400` rather than quietly launched at the standard cap.
- No `bankr launch` flag yet; use the agent or the deploy API from the command line.

### Deployment Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description | Example |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Yes | Full token name | "My Token" |
| **Symbol** | No | Ticker, 1-20 characters; defaults to the first 4 characters of the name if omitted | "MTK" |
| **Description** | No | Token description | "A community token" |
| **Image** | No | Logo URL or upload | URL or file |
| **Website** | No | Project website | "myproject.com" |
| **Twitter** | No | Associated tweet / X handle for social proof | "@myproject" |
| **Telegram** | No | Telegram group | "@mytoken" |
| **Fee Recipient** | No | Route creator fees to a wallet, ENS, or social handle | "@partner" |
| **Quote-only fees** | No | Collect all creator fees in the quote token; fixed at launch | `quoteOnlyFees: true` |
| **Degen mode** | No | Start at a $2,500 market cap; explicit opt-in, not on partner deploys | `degenMode: true` |
| **Paired stock** | No | Quote the pool in a registry tokenized stock instead of WETH | `pairedStockAddress: "0x…"` |
| **Paired quote token** | No | Base only — quote the pool in BNKR or ba3Pump instead of WETH; not combinable with a paired stock | `pairedTokenAddress: "0x…"` |

### Prompt Examples

**Deploy tokens:**
- "Deploy a token called BankrFan with symbol BFAN"
- "Create a memecoin: name=DogeKiller, symbol=DOGEK"
- "Deploy token with website myproject.com and Twitter @myproject"
- "Create a token on Base"
- "Launch MOON in degen mode"
- "Launch a token called CoolBot on robinhood"
- "Launch a token called CoolBot and route fees to @partner"
- "Launch a token with quote-only fees"

**Claim fees:**
- "Claim fees for my token MTK"
- "How much can I claim for MyToken?"
- "Claim legacy Clanker fees" (older tokens — claims auto-detect Doppler vs Clanker)

**Update metadata:**
- "Update description for MyToken"
- "Add Twitter link to my token"
- "Update logo for MyToken"

### Rate Limits

| User Type | Deploys per day | Gas-sponsored deploys per day |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Standard Users | 50 | 3 |
| Bankr Club Members | 100 | 10 |

The two limits are separate: the daily cap is how many tokens you may deploy, the sponsorship cap is how many of those Bankr pays gas for. Past the sponsorship cap you can keep deploying up to the daily cap by paying gas yourself. A deploy that fails before broadcast because of gas doesn't consume sponsorship quota, though it still counts against the daily cap.

**Past the sponsorship cap, a near-empty wallet is refused up front.** An unsponsored deploy checks the wallet's native balance against a conservative per-chain floor *before* building or broadcasting anything, and returns copy explaining that sponsorship is exhausted and what to do about it — rather than spending a signer round-trip to fail on-chain with a bare "not enough native token to cover gas". The floor is deliberately low, so borderline balances still proceed to real estimation downstream; sponsored deploys skip the check entirely. If you deploy programmatically past the sponsored quota, fund the deploying wallet with gas rather than relying on the retry.

A separate cross-account limit applies to fee recipients: an address may be named fee recipient on at most **20 deploys per 24 hours** across all accounts.

High-volume or bot-like deploy patterns can trigger automated spam protections and temporary or permanent restrictions. For legitimate programmatic deploy use cases, open a support ticket before scaling up.

### Stock-Paired Launches

Instead of pairing your token's pool with WETH, you can pair it with a registry **tokenized stock**, so the token trades against equity exposure rather than against ETH. Available on **Base** (B20 equities) and **Robinhood Chain**.

```bash
bankr agent prompt "Launch a token called Semis paired with NVDA on base"
```

```json
POST /token-launches/deploy
{ "name": "Semis", "symbol": "SEMIS", "chain": "base", "pairedStockAddress": "0x..." }
```

- Only stocks Bankr can price are offered — the launch curve's tick math needs a USD price, so an unpriceable stock would fail late rather than early.
- The same rule set validates the pairing in the launch wizard, the deploy API, and the agent, so what's offered is what's accepted.
- Pairing is fixed at launch, like the fee schedule.
- The pool's quote asset is the stock, so a swap leg that touches it is subject to that stock's location verification like any other stock trade.

### Fee Structure

- 0.7% swap fee on the pool, **95% of it to the creator** (0.665% of volume); the hook adds the Bankr protocol fee + BNKR buyback and LP fee on top, 1.75% all-in — see [Token Economics](#token-economics) for the full split
- The 0.285% LP fee is creator-side as well, strengthening your token's liquidity on every swap — 0.95% of volume working for your side in total
- Fees accrue in your token and WETH (quote token only on [quote-only](#quote-only-fees-optional-fixed-at-launch) launches); claimable anytime via "Claim fees for my token"
- Fee schedules are fixed at launch — older tokens keep the schedule they launched with
- Older tokens launched via Clanker are still claimable — the claim path auto-detects the protocol

### Deployment Process

1. **Specify Parameters**: Name (required); symbol, description, social links, fee recipient (optional)
2. **Contract Deployment**: Doppler deploys the ERC20 and creates the Uniswap V4 pool with automatic liquidity
3. **Verification**: Get the token address and pool metadata, view on a block explorer

### Taking Profit (Glidepath)

Selling a token you earn creator fees on through Bankr's swap/limit/stop/DCA/TWAP tools is restricted (buying and transferring are unaffected). To take profit, builders use a **Glidepath** — a capped, AI-paced gradual sell that feeds a committed slice of your tokens back into the pool over time instead of dumping. Glidepath is available for Base and Robinhood Chain launches and is managed from the token page at [bankr.bot](https://bankr.bot) (a web feature, not a CLI/API action). Details: https://docs.bankr.bot/token-launching/glidepath

## Common Issues

| Issue | Chain | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Rate limit reached | Both | Wait 24 hours or upgrade to Bankr Club |
| Name/symbol taken | EVM | Choose different name |
| Insufficient SOL | Solana | Add SOL for gas fees |
| NFT not found | Solana | Token may still be on bonding curve |
| Cannot transfer NFT | Solana | Permanent fee arrangement exists |
| No fees to claim | Solana | No trades yet or recently claimed |
| Token migrated | Solana | Use CPMM fee claiming instead |

## Best Practices

### Before Deploying
1. **Choose unique name/symbol** — Check availability
2. **Prepare branding** — Logo, description ready
3. **Choose right chain** — Solana for bonding curves, Base for ERC20
4. **Understand fees** — Know the fee structure for your chain

### During Deployment
1. **Solana**: Only tokenName is required — don't over-specify
2. **EVM**: Add metadata and social links immediately
3. **Save addresses** — Token address and any NFT mints

### After Deployment
1. **Check fee status** — "How much fees can I claim for TOKEN?"
2. **Claim fees regularly** — Don't leave money unclaimed
3. **Monitor migration** (Solana) — Fee Key NFT created at migration
4. **Engage community** — Marketing and updates

## Security Considerations

### Solana (LaunchLab)
- Bonding curve prevents rug pulls (liquidity locked)
- LP is automatically locked at migration
- Fee Key NFTs are standard SPL tokens
- Permanent fee arrangements are immutable
- Shared fee claims use atomic transactions (claim+transfer)

### EVM (Base / Doppler)
- Standard ERC20 with a fixed, non-mintable 100B supply
- Liquidity lives in a Uniswap V4 pool
- Verifiable on block explorer
- Creator controls metadata and fee routing

## Legal Considerations

**Disclaimer:**
- Token deployment may have legal implications
- Consider securities laws in your jurisdiction
- Consult legal counsel for serious projects
- Be transparent with community
- Don't make price promises

---

**Solana Tip**: Just say "Launch TOKEN_NAME" — only the name is required. Symbol defaults to name, and the bonding curve handles everything else.

**Fee Claiming Tip**: Both creator and fee recipient can claim fees during bonding curve. Just say "Claim my fees for TOKEN" — the system handles the split automatically.

**EVM Tip**: Add social links during deployment for better discoverability on aggregators.
