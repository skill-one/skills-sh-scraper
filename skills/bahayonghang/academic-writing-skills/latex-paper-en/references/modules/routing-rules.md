# Routing Rules — Full Detail

Extended routing guidance for `latex-paper-en`. The SKILL.md keeps only the core rules; this file preserves the full decision notes.

## Module inference

- Infer the module from the user request before asking follow-up questions. Ask for the module only when two or more modules are equally plausible after keyword routing.
- If the user asks for 2-3 compatible checks in one turn, run them sequentially instead of forcing a single-module reply.
- Execution order when multiple modules are needed: `compile` -> `bibliography` -> `format` -> `figures` / `tables` / `caption` / `pseudocode` -> `grammar` / `sentences` / `deai` -> `logic` / `literature` / `experiment` / `abstract` -> `section-writing` -> `title` / `expression` / `translation` / `adapt`.
- When applying multiple polish passes to the same prose, work coarse-to-fine — argument/logic -> sentence structure -> lexical/formatting — and do not reverse it; see `references/modules/workflow.md`.

## Choosing between adjacent modules

- Prefer `logic` for cross-section alignment requests (abstract vs introduction vs conclusion), introduction funnel issues, or contribution drift; prefer `literature` only when the problem is specifically about Related Work organization, comparison, or gap derivation.
- Prefer `section-writing` when the user asks to draft, rewrite, restructure, or reviewer-polish a specific section, or asks for paragraph roles, mini-outlines, reverse outlines, or claim-evidence maps. Prefer the diagnostic modules first when the user asks to check whether something is wrong.
- Keep `experiment` for results, discussion, baseline, ablation, significance, limitation, and conclusion-completeness concerns even if the user phrases them as "logic" problems.

## Special flags and loading rules

- For `section-writing`, load `references/modules/section-writing.md`, then exactly one active section guide from `references/writing/section-writing/` unless the user also asks for flow or self-review.
- For `journal narrative`, `Nature-style`, `Results narrative`, `Discussion structure`, `full-paper argument`, or `期刊式` requests, load `references/writing/article-architecture.md`. Do not load it for ordinary grammar polishing or conference-abstract polishing without a journal-structure request.
- For whole-paper motivation/red-thread questions ("does every introduction promise get tested and resolved?"), run `logic` with `--motivation-thread`; it appends a read-only Promise Map + Closure Map heuristic and leaves default `logic` output unchanged.
- For missing topic leads, weak paragraph endings, abrupt adjacent-paragraph interfaces, or single-sentence/flat expansion, run `logic --paragraph-arc` and load `references/writing/paragraph-arc.md`. The flag is opt-in, `--section` may narrow the existing section scope, and the output remains diagnostic with `Meaning-Check: NEEDS-LLM`; `logic` gains no rewrite contract.
- For graded de-AI / AIGC-dimension analysis, run `deai` with `--tier light|medium|heavy`; it scales thresholds, adds a D1 sentence-length check, and labels findings by dimension (D1-D5). Omitting `--tier` keeps the default output.

## Failure handling

- When a script fails, stop the current module, report the exact command plus exit code, and recommend the next smallest useful fallback instead of silently switching modules.

## Output contract details

- For `literature`, default to diagnosis + rewrite blueprint first; only produce paragraph-level rewriting when the user explicitly asks for prose.
- For `section-writing`, return a section objective, compact outline, paragraph roles, rewrite blueprint or prose proposal, claim-evidence map, and self-review checklist. Mark missing evidence instead of filling it.

## Rewrite contract scope

The single test is: **does the module emit text that can directly replace the source?** If it only emits an instruction about how to change something, the rewrite happens on the LLM side and only the `[LLM]` layer applies. The three groups are listed explicitly — do not extend the contract to a module because it "looks like polishing".

- **Contract applies (`[Script]` + `[LLM]` layers)**: `expression`, `grammar`, `sentences`, `translation`.
- **`[LLM]` layer only** (no script, or the script emits instructions rather than replacement text): `section-writing`, `caption`, `adapt`, `deai`. `deai` output such as `-> Suggestion: vary sentence length` is a behavioural instruction; the rewrite the LLM derives from it carries the `[LLM]`-layer fields.
- **Excluded — no contract block at all**: `compile`, `format`, `bibliography`, `figures`, `tables`, `pseudocode`, `logic`, `literature`, `experiment`, `abstract`, `title`. These are diagnostic; adding the fields there is noise.

### Layer rules

- `[Script]` may emit `Meaning-Check: NEEDS-LLM` only, and may set only `none`, `not-assessed`, `lexical-substitution`, `whitespace-normalized`. A rule engine that claims `PRESERVED` manufactures a false guarantee, which is worse than no contract at all.
- `[LLM]` may emit `PRESERVED` plus the full `Risk-Flags` closed set, but `PRESERVED` stays a proposal for the author to verify.
- `Risk-Flags` is a closed set: `none`, `not-assessed`, `lexical-substitution`, `whitespace-normalized`, `overstatement`, `ambiguity`, `terminology-drift`, `invented-claim`. Do not invent new values.
- A rewrite must never raise claim strength. When strength changes, set `Risk-Flags: overstatement` and cite `references/evidence/over-claim-guard.md` plus the four-level reporting-verb ladder in `references/writing/style-guide.md`.
- When the source meaning is genuinely unclear, flag `ambiguity` and offer the conservative reading — never silently pick the stronger one.

### Edit axes and asking boundary

- `--goal grammar|clarity|concision|coherence` is what the edit is for; `--strength minimal|moderate|restructure` is how far it may go. They are orthogonal: `--goal concision --strength minimal` and `--goal coherence --strength restructure` are both valid. `--goal` is not a severity ladder.
- Strength semantics, identical across skills:

| Value         | May change                                                  | Must not change                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `minimal`     | Wording, punctuation, clear grammar errors                  | Sentence structure, paragraph order          |
| `moderate`    | Above, plus splitting/merging sentences, reordering clauses | Paragraph order, adding or removing claims   |
| `restructure` | Above, plus paragraph order and topic-sentence placement    | Adding or removing claims (always forbidden) |

- All three levels stay under the core rule: never add a claim, mechanism, citation, result, limitation, method, or authorial intent that is not in the source.
- Defaults are `--goal grammar` and `--strength minimal` — the smallest change that solves the task.
- This does not turn into a questionnaire. The existing rule still holds: infer the module, do not ask by default. Ask about goal, strength, or author intent only when the answer would change this edit — for example when a sentence is ambiguous enough that two readings produce different rewrites.
- `--tier` keeps its existing meaning: `deai` detection sensitivity (light flags fewer items, heavy flags more). It is never reused as an edit-strength control, and the two vocabularies deliberately do not overlap.

## Safety rationale (full text)

- Don't invent citations, metrics, baselines, or experimental results — fabricated evidence is harder to retract once the user trusts it than a clearly flagged gap.
- Leave `\cite{}`, `\ref{}`, `\label{}`, custom macros, and math environments untouched by default — a stray edit there is far harder to spot in a diff than a prose edit, and breaks compilation silently.
- Treat generated prose as proposals, not commits — keep source-preserving checks separate from rewriting so the user can validate each step.
- Do not enable online bibliography checks unless the user explicitly asks for external verification or confirms that citation metadata may be sent to third-party APIs.
- The `deai` module improves readability; it is not a detector-evasion tool and does not remove a disclosure obligation. If an LLM had a non-trivial role in the paper, remind the user to disclose it per the target venue's policy (`references/venues/ai-disclosure.md` has the per-venue matrix — some venues require disclosure in the cover letter, a dedicated section, or the checklist).
