# De-AI Module Reference

Purpose: Detect and reduce AI-generated writing traces while preserving LaTeX syntax and technical accuracy.

## Core Principles

1. **Syntax preservation**: Never modify `\cite{}`, `\ref{}`, `\label{}`, math, or LaTeX commands
2. **Zero fabrication**: Never add data, metrics, comparisons, or claims
3. **Information density**: Every sentence must convey verifiable information
4. **Restrained wording**: Avoid unsupported certainty; use appropriate hedging
5. **Academic payload first**: Preserve the problem-method-evidence-conclusion-boundary chain before changing tone

## Academic Humanization Contract

Before removing "AI flavor", extract four protected buckets:

- **Facts/evidence**: data, formulas, experiments, figures, tables, citations, and metrics.
- **Claims/stance**: the author's actual conclusion, method choice, uncertainty, and limitation.
- **Logic**: chapter role, paragraph role, claim-evidence mapping, and cross-chapter closure.
- **Boundaries**: scope, assumptions, unverified points, and `待补证` items.

Only after these are clear should the module remove structure shells. The default output remains diagnostic findings, a risk summary, or a rewrite blueprint. Provide prose rewrites only when the user explicitly asks for them.

For the seven evidence-aware H-* pattern clusters and the `audit -> rewrite -> fidelity audit`
contract, progressively load [`pattern-clusters.md`](../deai/pattern-clusters.md). These are
claim-local `[LLM]` review prompts, not AI-authorship or detector-score rules.

Treat defensive speculative explanations as `[LLM]` findings: when a paragraph stacks
multiple mechanisms and then says the current data verify none of them, map each retained
mechanism to a visible evidence anchor or discriminating test. If no mechanism is supported,
state that it remains undetermined and move testable alternatives to future work. Do not
delete the caveat or strengthen the inference merely to sound decisive.

The script's `hedge` / `hedge_application` suggestions still correctly calibrate
over-confident wording and undemonstrated applications. `results suggest`, `may / could`,
and `可能/或许` reduce claim strength; they do not replace per-mechanism evidence.

## Chinese Density and Budget Semantics

- Chinese `term_thresholds` use `threshold_unit: per_10k_chars`; documents below 3,000 visible
  Chinese characters receive the configured fallback allowance instead of a noisy tiny denominator.
- Counts and denominators share one visible-prose adapter that excludes comments, citations,
  labels, math, figures, tables, and algorithms.
- `throat_clearing` uses a document-wide budget calibrated at 2.6 hits per 10,000 visible Chinese
  characters and reports only the excess occurrences.

## High-Priority AI Patterns (Must Fix)

| Pattern | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Empty adjectives | "显著提升" | Replace with specific metric: "MAE 降低 12%" |
| Absolute assertions | "显而易见", "必然" | Add qualification: "实验结果表明" |
| Vague quantifiers | "大量研究" | Use numbers: "三项研究 [1-3]" |
| Template openings | "近年来", "随着科技的飞速发展" | Start from specific problem context |
| Stacked citations | "[1]-[5]" without discussion | Discuss each cited work individually |
| Filler connectors | "总之", "不可否认的是", "值得注意的是" | Delete; state conclusion directly |
| Structure shells | "不是 A，而是 B", "真正的问题", "我的结论是：" | Keep only evidence-bearing contrasts; otherwise state the academic claim directly |
| Vague referents/comparatives | "这些东西", "更自然", "更适合" | Name the research object, baseline, and evaluation criterion |

## AI Density Scoring

| Score | Action |
|-------|--------|
| >70% | Urgent: immediate rewrite |
| 50-70% | High: rewrite soon |
| 30-50% | Medium: review and revise |
| <30% | Low: light polish only |

## Edit Types

1. Delete empty phrases  2. Add specifics  3. Split long sentences  4. Restructure  5. Downgrade certainty  6. Remove redundancy  7. Add missing subjects  8. Replace templates

## English-Abstract Tense Check (`[Script]` LOW)

`deai_check.py` also flags present-tense reporting verbs (`shows`, `presents`, `demonstrates`, `outperforms`, …) — but **only inside the English abstract**. Chinese prose has no tense, so the check is gated to the English-abstract region and stays silent everywhere else. It locates that region across the flagship templates: generic `\begin{abstract}`, thuthesis `\begin{abstract*}`, and pkuthss `\begin{eabstract}`; the Chinese `abstract` / `cabstract` environments are skipped, and when several abstracts coexist the English one is chosen by content language. A verb whose subject is a figure/table/equation (`Figure 2 shows ...`) is exempt. Each hit is a `[Script]` LOW trace suggesting past tense for methods/results.

See [`../writing/tense-guide-zh.md`](../writing/tense-guide-zh.md) for the judgment-level checklist (which verbs are borderline, why `is`/`are` are excluded).
