# PriceWin Deal Finder

> **Compare live hotel prices across Booking.com, Agoda, Google Hotels & OpenTravel in one command** — and get back ranked best-value, cheapest, and quality picks with direct booking links.

Stop opening five OTA tabs to find the real cheapest rate. Ask your agent *"find me a hotel in Tokyo for 12–15 Aug, 2 guests"* and this skill returns a clean, ranked comparison in ~30–60 seconds (cached cities).

**Invoke this skill for questions like:**
- "What's the cheapest hotel in `<city>` for `<dates>`?"
- "Is Booking.com or Agoda cheaper for this hotel?"
- "Compare hotel prices for `<city>`, `<N>` guests."
- "Find me a hotel under $`<X>`/night in `<city>`."
- "Best-value place to stay near `<landmark>` on `<dates>`?"

Each returns the same one-command answer below — no clarifying round-trip needed.

**What you get from one command:**
- 🥇 Best value · 🥈 Cheapest · 🥉 Quality — picked side-by-side
- Real per-night prices from up to **4 sources**, normalized to **USD**
- **Clickable booking links** straight to the cheapest OTA for each hotel
- Works for **any city worldwide** — including bot-hardened ones (Shanghai, Hangzhou, Bangkok…) via a stealth Patchright daemon
- No API keys, no MCP server — `node`/`npx` is all you need

**Sample result:**

```
🏨 Tokyo • Aug 12–15 • 3 nights • 2 guests
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🥇 BEST VALUE
Shinjuku Granbell Hotel
  ✅ agoda      💰 $118/night
     booking    💰 $131/night
     → Save $13 vs Booking
🥈 CHEAPEST
APA Hotel Shinjuku
  ✅ google     💰 $94/night
📊 18 hotels | agoda, booking, google, opentravel • prices in USD
```

## 🚨 IMPORTANT — HOW TO USE THIS SKILL

**ONE command does everything. Run this as your FIRST action — no clarifying questions first:**

```bash
cd {baseDir} && node bin/search.js "<city>" <checkInYYYY-MM-DD> <checkOutYYYY-MM-DD> <adults> en-us
```

`{baseDir}` is this skill's install directory (auto-resolved by the runtime). If your runtime does not substitute it, `cd` into the folder that contains this `SKILL.md` (the one with `bin/search.js`). Do NOT hardcode a `~/.hermes/...` or `~/.openclaw/...` path — it differs per platform.

Example:
```bash
cd {baseDir} && node bin/search.js "Hangzhou" 2026-06-10 2026-06-13 2 en-us
```

The script handles everything automatically: daemon launch, Agoda cache lookup, Google + Booking inline search, OpenTravel API lookup (all cities), discovery for new cities, and formatted tier-card output. Just run it and send the output to the user.

**DO NOT ask clarifying questions first.** Just run the command. Infer all parameters:
- **Year:** use the current year from today's date unless the user states otherwise. If the requested day/month has already passed this year, assume next year. (Get today's date with `date +%Y-%m-%d` if unsure.)
- **"10-13/6"** → `<year>-06-10 <year>-06-13` — fill `<year>` from the rule above
- **"2 guests" / "2 people"** → `2` adults
- **Locale:** language/region code passed to the OTAs (controls site language + region). Default `en-us`. Prices are in USD (Google Hotels is requested with `gl=us&curr=USD`); other sources follow the locale you pass.

**DO NOT use any other approach.** No Python scripts, no curl, no browser tools, no subagents. This one command is all you need.

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES — FOLLOW EVERY TIME

**RULE 0 — FORBIDDEN TOOLS. Read this twice.** This skill drives a long-running Patchright daemon via the `terminal` tool ONLY. Your runtime exposes several other tools that LOOK convenient but are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN inside this skill:

❌ `browser_navigate` / `browser_open` — FORBIDDEN
❌ `browser_click` — FORBIDDEN
❌ `browser_type` / `browser_fill` — FORBIDDEN
❌ `browser_snapshot` — FORBIDDEN
❌ `browser_close` — FORBIDDEN
❌ Any other `browser_*` native tool — FORBIDDEN
❌ `delegate_task` / `spawn_agent` / sub-agent delegation — FORBIDDEN

Why: those native tools spawn a vanilla Chromium without stealth, so Booking.com and Agoda detect the bot within seconds and the requests just hang until the runtime kills them with "Command timed out after 30/60 seconds". You will burn 5+ minutes on timeouts and the user will get nothing. The Patchright daemon launched via `terminal` survives bot-detection.

Delegated subagents start with empty history and no skill context — they will always fall back to Python/curl scraping, which gets bot-blocked immediately. **This skill must run entirely in the current agent, using only the `terminal` tool.**

✅ The ONLY allowed way to drive a browser in this skill is via `terminal`:
```
terminal: cd {baseDir} && node bin/search.js ...
```

**RULE 1 — `search.js` handles everything. NEVER scrape an OTA yourself.** Do not manually call `browse.js` commands, do not `goto`/`click`/`type` in the browser, do not build Agoda/Booking/Google URLs by hand, do not call the OpenTravel API separately, do not try to launch the daemon yourself. `search.js` already drives the stealth daemon through a careful flow that survives bot-detection — it handles Agoda discovery internally for EVERY city (including Chinese cities like Shanghai, Hangzhou, etc.). **Manually navigating an OTA is the #1 cause of failure: it trips Agoda/Booking anti-bot ("detect automation", "redirect to homepage", "problem completing your search") and gets the IP blocked.** Your ONLY job is to run `search.js` once and send its output. If you think a source is "missing", re-read RULE 4 — do NOT go fetch it by hand.

**RULE 2 — First-time city discovery takes 2–4 minutes.** If `search.js` output contains `"discovering"` or `"launching"` messages, tell the user: "First time searching this city — discovering selectors, this takes about 2–4 minutes..." and wait for the result. Do NOT retry or abort.

**RULE 3 — Send the output exactly.** `search.js` outputs formatted tier cards ready to send. Copy the output directly into your response. Do not reformat, summarize, or abbreviate it.

**RULE 3a — PRESERVE MARKDOWN HYPERLINKS.** Every hotel name in the output is already wrapped as `[Hotel Name](https://booking-url...)`. This is a clickable hyperlink — DO NOT:
- Strip the markdown and show the URL on a separate `🔗 https://...` line
- Replace `[Hotel Name](url)` with plain text
- Capitalize OTA names ("google" stays "google", not "Google")
- Rename sections — "📋 More good deals" stays exactly

The output is Telegram-MarkdownV2-ready. Sending it as-is gives the user clickable hotel names with hidden URLs (clean UI).

**RULE 3b — If you DO add a suggestion / commentary section after the output, every hotel name you mention MUST also be a markdown hyperlink `[Hotel Name](url)` using the SAME URL the script printed for that hotel.** Never write a hotel name as plain text in your own commentary.

**RULE 4 — Partial results are NORMAL and acceptable. Never "fix" them by hand.** A source can be absent from the output (e.g. Agoda blocked this run, or OpenTravel has no inventory for the city). That is FINE — send the tier cards with whatever sources are present. The footer (`📊 N hotels | <sources> • prices in USD`) lists exactly what was found. **Do NOT** try to fetch the missing source via the browser, a direct URL, or any other tool — that triggers anti-bot and makes things worse. If `search.js` errors out entirely, tell the user what failed in 1 line and show any partial output it printed above the error. If you want more coverage, the only valid retry is running the SAME `search.js` command again (anti-bot is often transient).

## Output Format Reference

`search.js` prints tier cards in this format — you send this directly to the user:

The hotel name is a Markdown link to its cheapest OTA. Price rows carry NO
links and the OTA key is shown lowercase (`agoda`/`booking`/`google`/`opentravel`).
There are no star ratings or area lines — the script does not have that data.

💡 Tip: <best Hotel Name>
   [Book on <OTA>](<link>) — <price>/night

📊 <N> hotels | <sources with data> • prices in USD
```

All prices are shown in USD. Agoda, Google and OpenTravel geo-lock to VND by IP and are converted via a live FX rate; Booking returns USD natively. Only sources that actually returned data are listed in the footer.

## Limitations

- First search per city pays the Agoda discovery cost (2–4 minutes). Google and Booking are inline (no discovery); OpenTravel is a direct API call.
- Subsequent searches reuse the Agoda cache and complete in ~30–60 seconds.
