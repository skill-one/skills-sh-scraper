# Housing Official Price

## What this skill does

`housing-official-price` looks up Korean official housing prices from the Ministry of Land 부동산공시가격알리미 (`realtyprice.kr`). It covers:

- apartment / 공동주택 official price histories by complex candidate + dong/ho selection
- individual-house / 개별주택 official price histories by 19-digit PNU

The source is a public read-only `realtyprice.kr` browser-visible public web data surface, not a documented OpenAPI / 공식 문서화된 OpenAPI가 아님. The package calls the upstream directly from the user's machine and does not use `k-skill-proxy`.

## Use the right neighboring skill

- `housing-official-price`: apartment and individual-house official prices (공동주택가격, 개별주택가격)
- `gongsijiga-search`: land official price / 개별공시지가, a per-square-meter land value for parcels
- `real-estate-search`: transaction data / 실거래가 and rent data, not government official price
- `building-register-search`: building register metadata / 건축물대장 표제부 such as use, area, floors, approval date

Do not present official prices as market value, transaction price, appraisal, tax/legal advice, ownership proof, or lien/right information.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Internet access
- `npm install housing-official-price`

No user login, CAPTCHA solving, API key, browser session, payment, or private credential is required. If `realtyprice.kr` shows a CAPTCHA/login/legal submission flow in the future, stop and ask for a manual source check instead of bypassing it.

## Access priority

1. Prefer a direct package call with synthetic or user-provided non-sensitive identifiers.
2. For individual houses, require an exact 19-digit PNU. Do not infer missing legal-dong/parcel digits.
3. For apartments, first call `searchApartmentCandidates({ complexName })`; if multiple candidates are returned, ask the user to choose or provide `aptCode`/`candidate`.
4. After an apartment candidate is fixed, call `lookupApartmentOfficialPrice` with explicit `dongCode`/`dongName` and `hoCode`/`hoName`. If dong/ho is ambiguous, stop and ask for a more specific selector.
5. Do not fall back to `k-skill-proxy`, VWorld, screen scraping, login automation, or unrelated real-estate datasets for this skill.

## API workflow

### Individual house by PNU

```bash
node -e "
const { lookupIndividualHousePriceByPnu } = require('housing-official-price');
lookupIndividualHousePriceByPnu('9999999999199999999')
  .then((result) => console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2)))
  .catch((err) => { console.error(err.code, err.message); process.exitCode = 1; });
"
```

### Apartment candidate search

```bash
node -e "
const { searchApartmentCandidates } = require('housing-official-price');
searchApartmentCandidates({ complexName: '샘플하우징' })
  .then((result) => console.log(JSON.stringify(result.candidates, null, 2)))
  .catch((err) => { console.error(err.code, err.message); process.exitCode = 1; });
"
```

If the candidate list has more than one row, show the user `complexName`, `roadAddress`, `landAddress`, `noticeDate`, and `aptCode`. Do not silently choose the first candidate.

### Apartment price history

```js
const { lookupApartmentOfficialPrice } = require("housing-official-price");

const result = await lookupApartmentOfficialPrice({
  candidate: {
    noticeDate: "20260626",
    aptCode: "99000001",
    complexName: "샘플하우징A동",
  },
  dongName: "A",
  hoName: "101",
});
```

## Output shape

All successful/empty responses include `source.api_documented: false` and `source.access: "public-web-data-surface"` so consumers remember this is a public web data surface, not a formal OpenAPI contract.

Individual-house OK response shape:

```json

  "status": "ok",
  "query": { "type": "individual-house", "pnu": "9999999999199999999" },

Apartment OK response shape:

  }
}
```

The client accepts both `model.list` and `modelMap.list`/`modelMap.totalCnt` response shapes because the browser-visible source has exposed both variants.

## Failure modes

| `error.code` | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `INVALID_PNU` | PNU is not exactly 19 digits or has an invalid land-type digit | Ask for a valid 19-digit PNU |
| `INVALID_SELECTOR` | Required apartment selector (`complexName`, `aptCode`, dong, ho) is missing or does not match returned choices | Ask for a more specific selector |
| `AMBIGUOUS_APARTMENT_CANDIDATE` | Multiple apartment candidates matched | Show candidates and ask the user to choose |
| `AMBIGUOUS_APARTMENT_DONG` / `AMBIGUOUS_APARTMENT_HO` | Multiple dong/ho choices matched | Ask for exact dong/ho code or name |
| `INDIVIDUAL_HOUSE_NOT_FOUND` / `APARTMENT_CANDIDATE_NOT_FOUND` | Upstream returned an empty result with zero count | Explain that the identifier may be wrong or not listed |
| `UPSTREAM_AMBIGUOUS_EMPTY` | Upstream reported `totalCnt > 0` but returned an empty/null list | Treat as upstream schema/data drift and retry later |
| `UPSTREAM_HTTP_ERROR` | Upstream HTTP was non-2xx | Retry later; include upstream status when safe |
| `UPSTREAM_MALFORMED_JSON` / `UPSTREAM_MALFORMED_HTML` | Upstream response could not be parsed | Treat as source drift/outage |
| `UPSTREAM_SCHEMA_DRIFT` | Expected list/detail fields were absent or invalid | Treat as source drift; do not guess |
| `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT` | Request exceeded the default 30s `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS` or caller timeout | Retry later or pass a bounded `timeoutMs` |
| `UPSTREAM_FETCH_ERROR` | Network failed before a response | Retry later; check connectivity |

## Rate, timeout, and safety policy

- Default timeout is `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS` = 30000. Pass `timeoutMs` for a tighter bound or `signal` to preserve caller-managed cancellation.
- Keep calls user-triggered and low volume. Avoid bulk crawling, background harvesting, or saving live response values into repository fixtures.
- Use synthetic examples such as `9999999999199999999` and `샘플하우징`; do not publish personal addresses, live apartment names, session cookies, or response captures.
- This skill is read-only. It never logs in, solves CAPTCHA, accepts terms on behalf of the user, submits forms beyond lookup requests, or makes legal/tax judgments.

## Done when

- You used the direct package API and produced either normalized JSON or a typed failure mode.
- Ambiguous apartment candidates/dong/ho choices were surfaced to the user instead of guessed.
- You clearly labeled the value as government official housing price, not market/transaction price.
- Source metadata says `api_documented: false` and `public-web-data-surface`.
