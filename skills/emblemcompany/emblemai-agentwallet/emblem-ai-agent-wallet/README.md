# Emblem Agent Wallet

Give AI agents their own crypto wallets. 250+ trading tools across 7 blockchains, powered by [EmblemAI](https://emblemvault.ai).

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @emblemvault/agentwallet
```

## Use from an MCP client

If you are using Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or any other MCP-compatible client, you do not need to install this CLI. Point the client at the hosted EmblemAI MCP server instead:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http EmblemAI https://emblemvault.ai/api/mcp
```

The hosted server handles OAuth 2.0 + PKCE in your browser — no API key to paste. API key and JWT bearer auth are also supported. Full install matrix for Claude Desktop, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Gemini CLI: https://emblemvault.ai/docs/mcp.

The CLI below stays the right choice for agent-mode automation, profile workflows, and local development.

## Usage

```bash
# Interactive mode (browser auth)
emblemai --profile hustle

# Agent mode (zero-config, single-shot)
emblemai --agent --profile hustle -m "What are my wallet addresses?"
```

If more than one profile exists in `~/.emblemai`, every agent-mode invocation must include `--profile <name>`. Agent mode never guesses which wallet identity to use.

## Supported Chains

Solana, Ethereum, Base, BSC, Polygon, Hedera, Bitcoin
