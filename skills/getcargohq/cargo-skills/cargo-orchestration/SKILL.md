# Cargo CLI — Orchestration

Runtime operations for the Cargo platform.

**What do you want to run?**

```
Need to run something?

```

> **Fanning out across many records (`action execute-batch`, `batch create`)? Sample first.** Run 10–20 records, report the observed cost and hit-rate, then ask the user to approve the full enrollment — quoting the **record count** and the **credit estimate**. See [Create a batch → the sample gate](#the-sample-gate).

> **Every node execution costs 0.01 credits — 1 credit per 100 — whatever the node is.**
> `branch`, `filter`, `switch`, `variables` and the rest carry no provider price, but
> they are not free: the charge is per *execution*, so a graph's cost has two terms,
> `(provider cost × records) + (nodes × records ÷ 100)`. On step-heavy, action-light
> graphs the second term dominates. It shows up in **no** per-node field — not
> `executions[].creditsUsedCount`, not `spans.execution_credits_used_count` — only in
> `billing usage get-metrics --unit orchestration.executions`. Quote both terms in the
> approval message ([`../cargo-gtm/references/cost-discipline.md`](../cargo-gtm/references/cost-discipline.md) §1).

> **Find the action before you hand-write the JSON.** `cargo-ai orchestration
> action list <keywords>` searches the integration catalog, Cargo native actions,
> workspace tools, and agents in one call — free, runs nothing — and each result
> carries a ready-to-paste `action` object (with `connectorUuid` already filled
> in), the action's **credit costs**, and its autocomplete slugs. Narrow with
> `--kind connector|native|tool|agent`, `--integration-slug <slug>`, `--limit`
> (default 20, max 50). `unknown command` means the CLI predates it — refresh.

> **`action execute`, not `node execute`, is the default for running something.**
> `node execute` is a **debug** surface for a node that already lives in a workflow:
> it requires `--workflow-uuid`, `--release-uuid`, `--node`, `--computed-config`
> **and** `--context` (all five, enforced client-side), and it bills like any live
> call. If you just want an operation's output — enrich a domain, call a connector
> action, invoke a tool or agent — use `action execute` / `action execute-batch`
> with a small `--action` + `--data` payload. Only reach for `node execute` when
> verifying one node's behavior before running the full graph.

> **Terminology:** An orchestration **tool** is a saved on-demand workflow (listed via `tool list`). An **action** is a single operation you execute without building a workflow — it can embed a saved orchestration tool (`kind: "tool"`), call a third-party connector (`kind: "connector"`), invoke an AI agent (`kind: "agent"`), or run a built-in platform operation (`kind: "native"`).

> **Composing a node graph? Prefer built-in actions + expressions.** Use the
> actions Cargo already provides plus template expressions; avoid `python`,
> `script` (JS), and raw HTTP nodes unless you truly have no alternative. Reshape
> data → `variables`; call an LLM and get parsed JSON → native `agent` node; call an
> API → the integration's dedicated **connector action**; route → `branch`/`filter`/`switch`.
> See **`references/node-selection.md`**.

> **Show the graph, don't describe it.** Before deploying a draft, and whenever
> the user asks what a workflow or play does, draw it:
> `cargo-ai orchestration node diagram --workflow-uuid <uuid> --format ascii --raw`
> (free, runs nothing; `--format` needs CLI ≥ 1.0.56, the command itself ≥ 1.0.54).
> Routing, fallback edges, and which steps bill are what the user is actually
> approving, and prose flattens all three. **Pick the format by where the output
> goes:** `ascii` renders a picture a person can read in a terminal or a chat
> reply; `mermaid` (the default) is source code, correct only when you are
> pasting into a PR, a doc, or a page that renders it. Sources, the ASCII legend,
> cost marking, and the duplicate-slug footgun: **`references/node-diagram.md`**.

## Bootstrap

Already signed in (`cargo-ai whoami` returns a workspace)? Skip to the next section.

```bash
npm install -g @cargo-ai/cli            # no global install? prefix every command with `npx @cargo-ai/cli`
cargo-ai login --email you@company.com  # emailed code, no browser; creates the account on first use
                                        # alternatives: --oauth (browser) · --token <api-token> (CI)
cargo-ai whoami                         # confirm the active workspace before any write
```

Every command prints JSON to stdout; failures exit non-zero with `{"errorMessage": "..."}`. Anything that creates a run or a batch is async — pass `--wait-until-finished` or poll the matching `get`. When the full skill bundle is installed, [`../cargo/references/prerequisites.md`](../cargo/references/prerequisites.md) adds the CLI version pin, token scopes, and the admin-only surface.

## Discover resources first

Most commands require UUIDs. Always discover them before acting.

```bash
cargo-ai orchestration action list <query>  # actions across connectors, native, tools, agents (+ credits)
cargo-ai orchestration play list            # all plays (name, workflowUuid, modelUuid, segmentUuid)
cargo-ai orchestration tool list            # all tools (name, workflowUuid, description)
cargo-ai orchestration workflow list        # all workflows (uuid only — no name)
cargo-ai orchestration template list       # all workflow templates (slug, name, kind)
cargo-ai ai agent list                     # all agents (uuid, name)
cargo-ai ai template list                  # all AI agent templates (slug, name, languageModelSlug)
cargo-ai storage model list                # all models (uuid, name, slug, columns)
cargo-ai storage dataset list              # all datasets
cargo-ai segmentation segment list         # all segments (uuid, name, modelUuid)
cargo-ai connection connector list         # all connectors
```

**Plays vs tools:** Both are backed by a workflow. A **play** is a segment-driven automation — it reacts to data changes in a segment (records added, updated, removed). A **tool** is an on-demand workflow — triggered manually, via API, or on a cron schedule. Workflows don't have a `name` field; use `play list` or `tool list` to find names and extract the `workflowUuid`.

**Retrieve in the UI:** plays live at `app.getcargo.io/workspaces/<WORKSPACE_UUID>/plays/<PLAY_UUID>` and tools at `app.getcargo.io/workspaces/<WORKSPACE_UUID>/tools/<TOOL_UUID>`. Get `<WORKSPACE_UUID>` from `cargo-ai whoami` under `workspace.uuid`.

**Designing a new tool or play?** Check templates first — they are pre-built node graphs for common automation patterns (enrichment pipelines, CRM syncs, lead scoring) and are an excellent starting point. List templates with `cargo-ai orchestration template list` and inspect a specific one with `cargo-ai orchestration template get <slug>`. Templates are tagged by `kind` so you can find ones suited for tools (`"kind":"tool"`) or plays (`"kind":"play"`) right away. See `references/examples/templates.md` for the full guide.

**Compatibility rules:**

- **`run create`** — only works with **tool** workflows (or no `workflowUuid`). Play workflows return `playNotCompatible`.
- **`batch create`** — allowed data kinds depend on the workflow type:
  - **Play** workflows: `filter`, `recordIds`, `segment`, `change`. Trigger a play with `filter`; `segment` takes a standalone segment only, never the `segmentUuid` from `play list`.
  - **Tool** workflows (or no `workflowUuid`): `file`, `records`

## Quick reference

```bash
# Find an action (free — no run, no credits)
cargo-ai orchestration action list enrich company
cargo-ai orchestration action list send --kind connector --integration-slug slack

# Single actions
cargo-ai orchestration action execute --action '{"kind":"tool","toolUuid":"<uuid>"}' --data '{"domain":"acme.com"}'
cargo-ai orchestration action execute-batch --action '{"kind":"connector","integrationSlug":"clearbit","actionSlug":"enrichCompany"}' --records '[{...},{...}]'
cargo-ai orchestration action get-output-schema --action '{"kind":"connector","integrationSlug":"clearbit","actionSlug":"enrichCompany"}' # → {"schema": <JSON Schema>} without executing

# Workflows (chain multiple actions)
cargo-ai orchestration run create --workflow-uuid <uuid> --data '{"company":"Acme","domain":"acme.com"}'
cargo-ai orchestration run create --data '{"domain":"acme.com"}' --nodes '[...]'
cargo-ai orchestration batch create --workflow-uuid <uuid> --data '{"kind":"filter","modelUuid":"...","filter":{"conjonction":"and","groups":[]}}'

# AI agents
cargo-ai ai message create --chat-uuid <uuid> --parts '[{"type":"text","text":"..."}]'

# Data
cargo-ai orchestration query execute "SELECT count() FROM runs WHERE status='error'" # ClickHouse: spans, runs, batches, records
cargo-ai segmentation segment fetch --model-uuid <uuid> --filter '{"conjonction":"and","groups":[]}' --fetching-limit 100
# For SQL against workspace storage (Companies, Contacts, …), see the cargo-storage skill: `storage query execute`
```

## Polling async operations

All operations are asynchronous. Either poll until terminal state, or pass `--wait-until-finished` to block.

`action execute` returns a run. `action execute-batch` returns a batch. They poll the same way:

| Result type     | Poll command         | Interval | Done when                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Run             | `run get <uuid>`     | 2s       | `status` is `success`, `error`, or `cancelled` |
| Batch           | `batch get <uuid>`   | 5s       | `status` is `success`, `error`, or `cancelled` |
| Agent message   | `message get <uuid>` | 2s       | `status` is `success` or `error`               |

For long-running batches (1000+ records), increase the interval to 10-15s after the first minute.

## Execute actions

Run a single action — no workflow or node graph needed.

### Find it first — `action list`

```bash
cargo-ai orchestration action list enrich company          # all kinds
cargo-ai orchestration action list --kind tool             # this workspace's tools
cargo-ai orchestration action list send --kind connector --integration-slug slack
```

Free, executes nothing. All query terms must match (AND); a hit on the action
slug or name ranks above the integration, which ranks above the description.
Returns `{query, totalMatches, results[]}` where each result carries `name`,
`description`, `score`, an `action` object to paste straight into `execute` /
`execute-batch` / `get-output-schema`, the workspace `connectors` for that
integration, `credits` (the cost table, when the action bills), and
`autocompletes` (config fields that need a picked id — a HubSpot object type, a
Slack channel). Defaults to 20 results, max 50.

```bash
# One action, one record → returns a run
cargo-ai orchestration action execute \
  --action '{"kind":"connector","integrationSlug":"clearbit","actionSlug":"enrichCompany"}' \
  --data '{"domain":"acme.com"}' \
  --wait-until-finished

# One action, many records → returns a batch
cargo-ai orchestration action execute-batch \
  --action '{"kind":"tool","toolUuid":"<tool-uuid>"}' \
  --records '[{"domain":"acme.com"},{"domain":"globex.com"}]' \
  --wait-until-finished
```

Action kinds: `tool`, `connector`, `agent`, `native`. See `references/examples/actions.md` for all action kinds, parameters, retry config, response shapes, and end-to-end examples.

> **A top-level action has no `config` — omit it.** Inputs belong in `--data` /
> `--records`; `execute` and `execute-batch` take the action with no `config` key
> at all, which is exactly what `action list` hands back, so its result pastes
> straight in. (`"config": {}` is still accepted there, harmlessly.)
>
> **`get-output-schema` takes the same pair.** The action object from
> `action list`, plus `--data` when the action's output depends on its inputs —
> a HubSpot object type or a target sheet decides which fields come back
> (`--data` needs **CLI ≥ 1.0.67**; the config-less `--action` works from 1.0.66).
> Workflow **nodes**, an alert's `--actions`, a play's `healthAlertActions`, and
> an agent's or MCP server's `--actions` are where `config` still lives; that is
> a node's configuration, not an action's input.
>
> **Inputs put in `config` are now dropped, not rejected.** The guard that used to
> answer `A top-level action does not use action.config…` is gone, so the action
> runs with *no input* — you get a provider-side missing-field error or an empty
> result that never mentions `config`. Check this first when a call comes back
> empty for no visible reason.

> **`execute-batch` bills per record.** Pass a 10–20 record slice of `--records` first, report the observed per-record cost and hit-rate, and get approval (with the full record count and credit estimate) before sending the rest — same gate as [Create a batch](#the-sample-gate).

### Resolve an action's output schema (without executing)

**Never guess what an action outputs.** Two free sources — no run, no credits:

1. **Connector actions:** the integration catalog carries the output schema inline — `integration get <slug>` (and `integration list`) return `actions.<actionSlug>.output.schema` next to the input `config.jsonSchema`. Not every action declares one.
2. **Any action kind** (`tool` / `connector` / `agent` / `native`) — resolve it with the same `--action` object as `action execute`:

```bash
cargo-ai orchestration action get-output-schema \
  --action '{"kind":"connector","integrationSlug":"clearbit","actionSlug":"enrichCompany"}'
# → {"schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {...}}}  — the JSON Schema is under the top-level "schema" key

# When the output depends on the inputs, pass them exactly as `execute` takes
# them (--data needs CLI >= 1.0.67):
cargo-ai orchestration action get-output-schema \
  --action '{"kind":"connector","integrationSlug":"hubspot","actionSlug":"findRecords"}' \
  --data '{"objectType":"contacts"}' 
```

Actions that declare no output schema fail with `"Action has no output schema."` (non-zero exit, status 404) — that's the signal to fall back to inspecting `runContext` from a real run. Use these to:

- Know which fields a downstream node can read (`{{nodes.<slug>.<field>}}`) **before** wiring the graph.
- See an `agent` action's real output envelope — a default free-text agent resolves to `{"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"answer":{"type":"string"}}}}`, which is why downstream references need `{{nodes.<slug>.answer...}}`.
- Map an action's output onto storage columns without a throwaway run.

See `references/examples/actions.md` ("Resolve an action's output schema") for verified per-kind examples and the response/error shapes.

## Create a run

A run processes a single record through a workflow. Use `run create` when you need to **chain multiple actions** together via a node graph, or when running an existing tool workflow.

**Runs only work with tool workflows.** Play workflows return `playNotCompatible` — use `batch create` instead.

```bash
cargo-ai orchestration run create \
  --workflow-uuid <tool.workflowUuid> \
  --data '{"company":"Acme","domain":"acme.com"}'
# → Poll with: cargo-ai orchestration run get <run-uuid>

# Or wait synchronously — blocks until the run reaches a terminal state and returns the final result
cargo-ai orchestration run create \
  --workflow-uuid <tool.workflowUuid> \
  --data '{"company":"Acme","domain":"acme.com"}' \
  --wait-until-finished
```

Also supports `--release-uuid` to pin a specific release.

**Cancelling runs:**

```bash
cargo-ai orchestration run cancel --workflow-uuid <uuid> --uuids run-uuid-1,run-uuid-2
```

See `references/examples/tools.md` for file uploads, monitoring, and cancellation. See `references/nodes.md` for custom node graphs.

## Create a batch

> **Sample first, then ask before enrolling everything — blocking.** A batch fans one workflow across every record in its data source, so a mistake and a full bill land together. Never enroll a full segment/file/model on the first attempt: run a **10–20 record sample**, report what it cost and returned, then ask the user to approve the full enrollment with the **record count and credit estimate** in the question. Mechanics below; the spend rules behind it are [`../cargo-gtm/references/cost-discipline.md`](../cargo-gtm/references/cost-discipline.md).

### The sample gate

**1. Count the pool first (free).** Never quote an estimate from a guess:

```bash
cargo-ai segmentation segment get <segment-uuid>          # → recordsCount (also on `segment list`)
cargo-ai storage query execute "SELECT count() FROM <dataset>.<model>"   # for a filter/model source
# For a file source: wc -l on the CSV, minus the header row.
```

**2. Run 10–20 records through the exact workflow and config.** Sample by data kind:

```bash
# Play workflow, segment source → reuse the segment's own filter, capped by `limit`
cargo-ai segmentation segment get <segment-uuid>          # → copy .filter and .modelUuid
cargo-ai orchestration batch create \
  --workflow-uuid <play.workflowUuid> \
  --data '{"kind":"filter","modelUuid":"<modelUuid>","filter":<segment.filter>,"limit":15}' \
  --wait-until-finished

# Play workflow, explicit records → pick 10–20 ids
cargo-ai orchestration batch create \
  --workflow-uuid <play.workflowUuid> \
  --data '{"kind":"recordIds","modelUuid":"<modelUuid>","ids":["id-1","…","id-15"]}'

# Tool workflow, inline records → slice the array
cargo-ai orchestration batch create \
  --workflow-uuid <tool.workflowUuid> \
  --data '{"kind":"records","records":[ /* first 15 only */ ]}'

# Tool workflow, file → upload a truncated CSV (header + 15 rows), not the full file
head -n 16 leads.csv > leads-sample.csv
cargo-ai workspaceManagement file upload --file ./leads-sample.csv
```

`limit` is the sampling lever for `kind: "filter"`. `kind: "segment"` and `kind: "change"` have **no limit** — they always enroll the whole set, so sample via `filter` or `recordIds` and switch to `segment` only for the approved full run.

**3. Report the sample, then ask.** The confirmation must carry both numbers the user needs to decide:

```
Sample: 15 of 1,240 records · 6.2 credits (0.41/record) · 13/15 enriched (87%)
Full enrollment: 1,225 remaining records ≈ 502 credits (balance: 780)

Enroll all 1,225? Or:
  1. Enroll all 1,225 (≈502 cr, leaves ~278)
  2. Trim scope — e.g. the 610 records with a domain set (≈250 cr)
  3. Stop here and review the sample output first
```

Wait for an explicit answer. **Do not enroll the full set on an unanswered question**, and don't treat approval of the sample as approval of the full run. Skip the gate only when the batch is free (no paid nodes) *and* small, or when the user has already named the scope and approved the cost this session.

Batches process multiple records at once. Allowed data kinds depend on the workflow type:

- **Play** workflows: `filter`, `recordIds`, `segment`, `change`
- **Tool** workflows (or no `workflowUuid`): `file`, `records`

Use `filter` to trigger a play — it queries the model directly. `segment` only
accepts a **standalone** segment from `segmentation segment list`; passing the
`segmentUuid` that `play list` returns is rejected (`segmentLinkedToPlay`, or
`noRecords` on older backends) because a play's generated segment never has a
populated record count.

```bash
# Play workflow — run over the play's model (empty filter = all rows)
cargo-ai orchestration batch create \
  --workflow-uuid <play.workflowUuid> \
  --data '{"kind":"filter","modelUuid":"...","filter":{"conjonction":"and","groups":[]}}'

# Tool workflow — run on a file
cargo-ai orchestration batch create \
  --workflow-uuid <tool.workflowUuid> \
  --data '{"kind":"file","s3Filename":"..."}'
# → Poll with: cargo-ai orchestration batch get <batch-uuid>

# Or wait synchronously — blocks until the batch reaches a terminal state and returns the final result
cargo-ai orchestration batch create \
  --workflow-uuid <play.workflowUuid> \
  --data '{"kind":"filter","modelUuid":"...","filter":{"conjonction":"and","groups":[]}}' \
  --wait-until-finished
```

**Downloading results:** get the `releaseUuid` from batch get, then `cargo-ai orchestration release get <release-uuid>` to find `nodes[].slug`, then `cargo-ai orchestration batch download --uuid <batch-uuid> --output-node-slug <slug>`.

**Cancelling a batch:**

```bash
cargo-ai orchestration batch cancel <batch-uuid>
```

See `references/examples/plays.md` and `references/examples/tools.md` for filtering, record IDs, file uploads, monitoring, and cancellation.

## Send a message to an AI agent

```bash
cargo-ai ai agent list                                    # 1. Find the agent
cargo-ai ai chat create \                                 # 2. Create a chat
  --trigger '{"type":"draft"}' \
  --agent-uuid <agent-uuid> --name "Research session"
cargo-ai ai message create \                              # 3. Send a message
  --chat-uuid <chat-uuid> \
  --parts '[{"type":"text","text":"Find the VP of Sales at Acme Corp"}]'
# → Extract assistantMessage.uuid, poll with: cargo-ai ai message get <uuid>
#   Done when .message.status is "success" (read .parts) or "error" (read .errorMessage)
```

Also supports `--actions`, `--resources`, `--language-model-slug`, `--temperature`, `--max-steps`, and `--wait-until-finished` (blocks until the assistant message reaches a terminal status). See `references/examples/agents.md` for multi-turn conversations, action/resource injection, and model selection.

## Inspect records

Records are individual items processed by a workflow. Use these commands to list, count, download, or cancel records within a workflow.

```bash
# List records for a workflow
cargo-ai orchestration record list --workflow-uuid <uuid> --limit 50

# Filter by batch or status
cargo-ai orchestration record list --workflow-uuid <uuid> --batch-uuid <uuid> --statuses error

# Count records
cargo-ai orchestration record count --workflow-uuid <uuid>

# Download records as a file
cargo-ai orchestration record download --workflow-uuid <uuid>

# Get per-node execution metrics
cargo-ai orchestration record get-metrics --workflow-uuid <uuid>

# Cancel records
cargo-ai orchestration record cancel --workflow-uuid <uuid> --ids record-id-1,record-id-2
```

## Query orchestration history (orchestration query)

Run SQL against orchestration runtime tables — `spans`, `runs`, `batches`, `records` — with `orchestration query execute`. Use this for ad-hoc analytics on workflow execution (error rates, throughput, slowest nodes) without the workflow-scoped filters of `run get-metrics` / `run count`.

```bash
cargo-ai orchestration query execute "SELECT count() FROM runs WHERE status = 'error'"
cargo-ai orchestration query execute "SELECT status, count() FROM batches GROUP BY status"
cargo-ai orchestration query execute "SELECT * FROM spans ORDER BY execution_started_at DESC LIMIT 10"
```

Tables are referenced without a schema prefix — just `spans`, `runs`, `batches`, or `records`. Workspace scoping is applied automatically. The query is read-only; DDL, table functions, dictionary accessors, and introspection are denied. See `references/examples/queries.md` for the schemas, example queries, and limits.

## Fetch segment data

Retrieve live records from a segment. **IMPORTANT:** requires `--model-uuid` (not `--segment-uuid`). Get the `modelUuid` from `segment list`. Filter JSON uses `conjonction` (not `conjunction`) — this is intentional.

```bash
cargo-ai segmentation segment fetch \
  --model-uuid <uuid> \
  --filter '{"conjonction":"and","groups":[]}' \

```

Supports `--sort`, `--enrich`, and `--sync`. See `references/filter-syntax.md` for the full filter syntax and `references/examples/segments.md` for filtering, pagination, sorting, enrollment filters, and enrichment.

**Managing segments:**

```bash
# Update a segment's name or filter
cargo-ai segmentation segment update --uuid <segment-uuid> --name "Updated Name"
cargo-ai segmentation segment update --uuid <segment-uuid> --filter '{"conjonction":"and","groups":[...]}'

# Remove a segment (fails if linked to a workflow)
cargo-ai segmentation segment remove <segment-uuid>
```

## Use a workflow template

Templates are pre-built node graphs for common automation patterns (enrichment pipelines, CRM syncs, lead scoring). Browse with `template list`, inspect with `template get <slug>`, fill in placeholders, validate, and run.

```bash
cargo-ai orchestration template list              # list available templates
cargo-ai orchestration template get <slug>        # get template nodes + config
```

See `references/examples/templates.md` for the full guide including placeholder conventions and end-to-end examples.

## Validate and test nodes

Always validate custom node graphs before running them.

```bash
cargo-ai orchestration node validate --nodes '[...]'
# → { "outcome": "valid" } or { "outcome": "notValid", "invalidNodes": [...] }
```

Then **show it before deploying it** — `validate` proves the graph is well-formed,
not that it does what the user asked for:

```bash
cargo-ai orchestration node diagram --nodes '[...]' --format ascii --raw   # free, runs nothing
```

Same command draws a deployed workflow (`--workflow-uuid`), a draft (`--draft`), a
release (`--release-uuid`), or the graph a run executed (`--run-uuid`). See
`references/node-diagram.md`.

For debugging, use `node compute` (dry-run expressions) or `node execute` (live test of one node **of an existing workflow** — needs `--workflow-uuid` + `--release-uuid` + `--computed-config`, and costs credits; for anything that isn't node-level debugging, use `action execute` instead). For runs that complete with `status: success` but produce wrong output (wrong branch taken, empty downstream values), use `run.executions[].title` from `run get` only as a quick summary — it may be truncated — and read `runContext.<nodeSlug>` (returned at the top level of the same `run get <run-uuid>` response) to verify field-level data. See `references/troubleshooting.md` → "Debugging a workflow run" and `references/nodes.md` for the full node creation guide, validation error codes, and examples.

## Help

Every command supports `--help`:

```bash
cargo-ai orchestration run create --help
cargo-ai orchestration template list --help
cargo-ai orchestration node validate --help
cargo-ai ai message create --help
cargo-ai orchestration query execute --help
```
