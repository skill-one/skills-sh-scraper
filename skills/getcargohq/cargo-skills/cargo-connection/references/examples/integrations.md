# Integration examples

## List all available integrations

```bash
cargo-ai connection integration list
```

Response includes `slug`, `name`, `description`, and `category` for each available integration.

## Filter integrations

```bash
# By category
cargo-ai connection integration list --category enrichment

# By name search
cargo-ai connection integration list --search "hubspot"

# By exact slug(s)
cargo-ai connection integration list --slugs clearbit

# Only those with actions (usable in workflow nodes)
cargo-ai connection integration list --has-actions true

# Only those with extractors (can sync data into models)
cargo-ai connection integration list --has-extractors true
```

**Categories:** `engagement`, `marketing`, `sales`, `finance`, `analytics`, `freeform`, `success`, `support`, `enrichment`, `storage`, `custom`.

## Find an integration slug

```bash
cargo-ai connection integration list --search "hubspot"
# → Extract the "slug" value
# → Use slug when creating connectors: --integration-slug <slug>
```

## Get full integration details

```bash
cargo-ai connection integration get clearbit
# → Returns the full integration object with actions, extractors, and configuration schemas
```

Use this to discover all available actions and extractors for an integration, including their `config.jsonSchema` for building workflow nodes.

## Get integration documentation

```bash
cargo-ai connection integration get-documentation clearbit
cargo-ai connection integration get-documentation hubspot
```

Returns plain text documentation for the integration, including available actions and their configuration.

## Discover actions for a specific integration (e.g. HubSpot)

```bash
cargo-ai connection integration get hubspot
# → Returns HubSpot-specific actions (e.g. "create_contact", "update_deal") and extractors
# → Each action includes its config.jsonSchema for building workflow nodes

cargo-ai connection integration get-documentation hubspot
# → Plain text overview of all HubSpot actions
```

**Use `integration get <slug>` when you need service-specific actions** — HubSpot, Salesforce, Clearbit, etc.

## Discover native (built-in Cargo) actions and extractors

```bash
cargo-ai connection native-integration get
# → Returns built-in Cargo actions ONLY — NOT HubSpot or other third-party actions
# → actions: keyed by actionSlug (generic platform utilities)
# → extractors: keyed by extractor slug
```

**Important:** `native-integration get` does **not** return HubSpot-specific or other third-party connector actions. To get those, use `integration get <slug>` instead.

Use `actionSlug` values in workflow node configs (see `cargo-orchestration/references/nodes.md`).

## Set up a connector for use in workflows (full flow)

```bash
# 1. Find the integration slug
cargo-ai connection integration list --search "hubspot"
# → Extract the "slug" value

# 2. Create the connector
cargo-ai connection connector create \
  --integration-slug hubspot \
  --slug hubspot_production \
  --name "HubSpot - Production"
# → Note the returned connector UUID

# 3. Get the integration details to discover available actions
cargo-ai connection integration get hubspot
# → Or get plain text docs: cargo-ai connection integration get-documentation hubspot

# 4. Use the connector UUID and action slug in a workflow node
# See cargo-orchestration references/nodes.md for node syntax
```
