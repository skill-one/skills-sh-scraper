# Cargo CLI — Analytics

Measurement and export: monitoring run metrics, downloading run and batch results, and exporting segment data.

> See `references/response-shapes.md` for full JSON response structures.
> See `references/troubleshooting.md` for common errors and how to fix them.
> See `references/examples/run-analytics.md` for run metrics and error monitoring.
> See `references/examples/exports.md` for data export and download examples.
> For billing, usage metrics, and subscription: use the `cargo-billing` skill.

## Bootstrap

Already signed in (`cargo-ai whoami` returns a workspace)? Skip to the next section.

```bash
npm install -g @cargo-ai/cli            # no global install? prefix every command with `npx @cargo-ai/cli`
cargo-ai login --email you@company.com  # emailed code, no browser; creates the account on first use
                                        # alternatives: --oauth (browser) · --token <api-token> (CI)
cargo-ai whoami                         # confirm the active workspace before any write
```

Every command prints JSON to stdout; failures exit non-zero with `{"errorMessage": "..."}`. Anything that creates a run or a batch is async — pass `--wait-until-finished` or poll the matching `get`. When the full skill bundle is installed, [`../cargo/references/prerequisites.md`](../cargo/references/prerequisites.md) adds the CLI version pin, token scopes, and the admin-only surface.

## Scope — measure and export, not explain

This skill answers **"what happened"** and **"give me the data"**: metrics, counts, downloads, exports. The moment the question becomes **"why"** — why did this run fail, why is the output wrong or empty, which root cause explains these errors, why is this play so expensive — switch to the `cargo-diagnostics` skill; its runbooks sequence the raw surfaces into a diagnosis.

| The question sounds like… | Load |
| --- | --- |
| "What's the error rate?" / "How many runs failed this week?" / "Export the results / segment" | **this skill** |
| "Why did this run fail?" / "Run succeeded but the output looks wrong" | `cargo-diagnostics` → `references/run-trace.md` |
| "Why does this batch have errors? Which node keeps failing, and is it one cause or many?" | `cargo-diagnostics` → `references/batch-error-sweep.md` |
| "Why is this play so expensive? Where do the credits go?" | `cargo-diagnostics` → `references/play-optimize-credits.md` |

The two skills chain naturally: analytics **detects** (error rate spiked, batch reports failures), diagnostics **explains** (18 of 20 failures share one root cause), then analytics **retrieves** the clean results once the cause is fixed and the runs re-executed.

## Discover resources first

Most analytics commands require UUIDs. Discover them before querying.

```bash
cargo-ai orchestration play list            # all plays (name, workflowUuid)
cargo-ai orchestration tool list            # all tools (name, workflowUuid)
cargo-ai orchestration workflow list        # all workflows (uuid only — no name)
cargo-ai ai agent list                     # all agents (uuid, name)
cargo-ai connection connector list          # all connectors (uuid, name, integrationSlug)
cargo-ai storage model list                # all models (uuid, name, slug)
```

## Quick reference

```bash
cargo-ai orchestration run get-metrics --workflow-uuid <uuid>
cargo-ai orchestration run download --workflow-uuid <uuid> --is-finished
cargo-ai orchestration run count --workflow-uuid <uuid> --statuses error
cargo-ai orchestration query execute "SELECT status, count() FROM runs GROUP BY status"
cargo-ai segmentation segment download --model-uuid <uuid> --filter '{"conjonction":"and","groups":[]}'
```

**Picking the right command:**

- `run get-metrics` / `run count` — workflow-scoped, predefined aggregations. Best when you already have a `workflowUuid`.
- `orchestration query execute` — ad-hoc SQL across the entire workspace (`runs`, `batches`, `spans`, `records`). Best for cross-workflow analytics, per-node breakdowns, and time-series.
- `run download` / `run download-outputs` — per-record output retrieval.
- `segment download` / `storage query execute` — storage data (Companies, Contacts, …).

## Workflow run metrics

Aggregated metrics for workflow runs (success/error rates, credits per node).

```bash
# Metrics for a workflow
cargo-ai orchestration run get-metrics --workflow-uuid <uuid>

# Scoped to a release, batch, or date range
cargo-ai orchestration run get-metrics --workflow-uuid <uuid> --release-uuid <uuid>
cargo-ai orchestration run get-metrics --workflow-uuid <uuid> --batch-uuid <uuid>
cargo-ai orchestration run get-metrics --workflow-uuid <uuid> \
  --created-after <start-date> --created-before <end-date>
```

## Run count

Count runs matching specific criteria — useful for monitoring.

```bash
cargo-ai orchestration run count --workflow-uuid <uuid> --statuses error
cargo-ai orchestration run count --workflow-uuid <uuid> --is-finished \
  --created-after <start-date> --created-before <end-date>
cargo-ai orchestration run count --workflow-uuid <uuid> --batch-uuid <uuid>
```

Supports: `--statuses`, `--batch-uuid`, `--release-uuid`, `--is-finished`, `--created-after`, `--created-before`, `--record-id`, `--record-title`.

For cross-workflow analytics or shapes that `run count` doesn't expose (per-node failure breakdowns, p95 durations, error rate over time), use `orchestration query execute` — see the [Ad-hoc execution analytics](#ad-hoc-execution-analytics-orchestration-query) section.

## Ad-hoc execution analytics (`orchestration query`)

Run SQL against orchestration runtime tables — `runs`, `batches`, `spans`, `records` — for analytics that the canned metrics commands don't cover. Tables are referenced without a schema prefix; workspace scoping is automatic. See `cargo-orchestration/references/examples/queries.md` for schemas and limits.

```bash
# Error rate across the workspace in the last day
cargo-ai orchestration query execute \
  "SELECT countIf(status='error') / count() AS error_rate FROM runs WHERE created_at > now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY"

# Failed runs per workflow this week
cargo-ai orchestration query execute \
  "SELECT workflow_uuid, count() AS errors FROM runs WHERE status='error' AND created_at > now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY GROUP BY workflow_uuid ORDER BY errors DESC"

# Per-node failure counts (last 24h)
cargo-ai orchestration query execute \
  "SELECT node_slug, count() AS failures FROM spans WHERE execution_status='error' AND execution_started_at > now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY GROUP BY node_slug ORDER BY failures DESC"

# Credit spend by workflow this month
cargo-ai orchestration query execute \
  "SELECT workflow_uuid, sum(credits_used_count) AS credits FROM batches WHERE created_at >= toStartOfMonth(now()) GROUP BY workflow_uuid ORDER BY credits DESC"
```

Read-only and capped: 30s execution time, 10 000 result rows, 10 000 000 rows scanned. Narrow with a `created_at`/`execution_started_at` predicate to stay under the row-scan cap.

## Downloading run results

Two distinct commands — pick the right one for the job.

### `run download` — one row per run, one column per node (gzipped CSV)

Returns `{"url": "..."}` — a signed URL to a **gzipped CSV**. Each row is a run: `_uuid`, `_workspace_uuid`, `_workflow_uuid`, `_record_id`, `_record_title`, `_created_at`, `_finished_at`, `_status`, `_error_message`, followed by **one column per node slug**.

**Each node column holds that execution's `title` — a truncated human-readable summary, not the node's output.** There is no `runContext` and no `executions[]` in this file. Treat it as a status board across many runs (which node errored, on which record), never as evidence of what a node produced — the same rule `cargo-diagnostics` applies to `title` everywhere else.

```bash
# Every run of a workflow
cargo-ai orchestration run download --workflow-uuid <uuid>

# Date range
cargo-ai orchestration run download --workflow-uuid <uuid> \
  --created-after <start-date> --created-before <end-date>

# Specific statuses (run statuses: idle, pending, running, success, error,
# cancelling, cancelled, skipped — NOT "finished"/"failed")
cargo-ai orchestration run download --workflow-uuid <uuid> --statuses success,error

# Every run that reached a terminal state. `--is-finished` is `finished_at IS
# NOT NULL`, which is wider than success+error: cancelled and skipped runs
# stamp finishedAt too, so don't substitute one for the other.
cargo-ai orchestration run download --workflow-uuid <uuid> --is-finished

# From a specific batch
cargo-ai orchestration run download --workflow-uuid <uuid> --batch-uuid <uuid>
```

### `run download-outputs` — per-run input + output (CSV/JSON via signed URL)

**This is the canonical way to get action results out of the platform.** Maps to API `POST /v1/orchestration/runs/download-outputs`. Returns `{"url": "..."}` — a signed URL to a CSV (default) or JSON file. One row per run: the same `_`-prefixed run metadata, plus `input` (the first node's resolved config) and `output` (the chosen node's context, defaulting to the **last executed node** when `--output-node-slug` is omitted).

```bash
# --workflow-uuid is the only required flag
cargo-ai orchestration run download-outputs \
  --workflow-uuid <uuid> \
  --format json \
  --limit 20

# Pin the output node explicitly, and filter by batch
cargo-ai orchestration run download-outputs \
  --workflow-uuid <uuid> \
  --output-node-slug <slug> \
  --batch-uuid <uuid>
```

To find the `output-node-slug`: `cargo-ai orchestration release get <release-uuid>` → look at `nodes[].slug`. The terminal output node is typically named `output` or `end`. Without `--limit`, the file covers **every** matching run of the workflow, so pass one when you only need a sample.

### Getting the full `runContext` for several runs

You can't, in one call. The full per-node context is a **per-run S3 object**, and `orchestration run get <run-uuid>` is the only command that hydrates it — one run at a time. The two exports above are projections: `download` gives you node *titles* across many runs, `download-outputs` gives you first-node input + one node's output across many runs. For everything in between, loop `run get` over the UUIDs from the discovery ladder in [`../cargo-diagnostics/references/run-trace.md`](../cargo-diagnostics/references/run-trace.md) § 0.

Orchestration SQL is not an alternative here: `runs` and `spans` carry status, timing, and credits, but no node input/output columns.

## Downloading batch results

```bash
cargo-ai orchestration batch download --uuid <batch-uuid> --output-node-slug <node-slug>
```

To find the `output-node-slug`: run `cargo-ai orchestration release get <release-uuid>` (get the release UUID from the batch) and look at `nodes[].slug`.

## Handling partial batch failures

A batch with `status: "success"` can still contain individual run failures. Always inspect the batch for errors before treating results as complete.

**Step 1 — Check the batch summary:**

```bash
cargo-ai orchestration batch get <batch-uuid>
# → .runsCount          = total records submitted
# → .executedRunsCount  = records that reached a terminal state (success or error)
# → .failedRunsCount    = records that errored
```

**Step 2 — Count and download the failed runs:**

```bash
cargo-ai orchestration run count \
  --workflow-uuid <uuid> \
  --batch-uuid <batch-uuid> \
  --statuses error

cargo-ai orchestration run download \
  --workflow-uuid <uuid> \
  --batch-uuid <batch-uuid> \
  --statuses error
```

**Step 3 — Diagnose.** Working out *why* they failed — grouping failures by root cause, picking exemplar runs, reading `runContext` — is the `cargo-diagnostics` skill's job: load `../cargo-diagnostics/references/batch-error-sweep.md` and feed it the batch UUID.

**Step 4 — Re-run only the failed records:**

After the diagnosis and fixing the underlying issue (connector credentials, bad input data, rate limits):

```bash
# Extract record IDs from the failed run download, then:
cargo-ai orchestration batch create \
  --workflow-uuid <uuid> \
  --data '{"kind":"recordIds","recordIds":["id1","id2","id3"]}'
```

**Filtering by node output slug:**

To download only a specific node's output from a batch (e.g. just the enrichment node, not the full run):

```bash
# 1. Get the release UUID from the batch
cargo-ai orchestration batch get <batch-uuid>
# → .releaseUuid

# 2. Find the node slug
cargo-ai orchestration release get <release-uuid>
# → nodes[].slug

# 3. Download that node's output
cargo-ai orchestration batch download \
  --uuid <batch-uuid> \
  --output-node-slug <node-slug>
```

## Segment data export

Filter JSON uses `conjonction` (not `conjunction`) — this is intentional. See the `cargo-orchestration` skill's `references/filter-syntax.md` for the full filter syntax.

```bash
# Full export (all records)
cargo-ai segmentation segment download \
  --model-uuid <uuid> \
  --filter '{"conjonction":"and","groups":[]}'

# With sorting and limit
cargo-ai segmentation segment download \
  --model-uuid <uuid> \
  --filter '{"conjonction":"and","groups":[]}' \
  --sort '[{"columnSlug":"created_at","kind":"desc"}]' \
  --limit 1000
```

**IMPORTANT:** `segment download` requires `--model-uuid`, not `--segment-uuid`. Get the `modelUuid` from `segment list`.

For live paginated queries with enrichment, use `segmentation segment fetch` from the `cargo-orchestration` skill.

## Help

Every command supports `--help`:

```bash
cargo-ai billing usage get-metrics --help
cargo-ai orchestration run download --help
cargo-ai segmentation segment download --help
```
