# Recipe — Custom datapoints and live signals

Use this recipe when the user asks **which fields they should be collecting**, not how to fill a field they have already named. It designs an account schema — a shortlist of custom attributes and live signals specific to what they sell — then wires the survivors into columns, scoring, segments, and a refresh cadence.

**Trigger phrases:**

- *"What custom data points should we be collecting on our accounts?"*
- *"What buying signals should we watch for?"*
- *"Our scoring is industry + headcount and every competitor has the same list."*
- *"Design the enrichment schema for our ICP."*
- *"Given ten companies that all look the same, what would tell us which one to work first?"*

Adjacent recipes answer different questions: [`icp-discovery.md`](icp-discovery.md) derives fit from the user's own Won/Lost history (needs closed deals); [`source-planning.md`](source-planning.md) sources **one** field the user already named. This one runs when there are no closed deals to mine and no field named yet — the blank-page case.

## The failure this prevents

Any competent model will produce ten plausible attributes for any domain in one pass. The standard output of that exercise is a document where four attributes have no obtainable source, three cost more per account than the account is worth, and two were already columns in the workspace. It reads well and changes nothing.

The work is not generating candidates. It is **killing the ones that cannot be filled** — and the only honest way to do that is to name the action slug, the cost per account, and a probed hit rate before the list reaches the user.

## Step 0 — Whose accounts are we describing?

The domain in the ask is almost always the **seller**: the company whose GTM team wants better segmentation. The attributes you design describe **their target accounts**, not the seller.

Confirm in one line before researching anything — "so: attributes about the companies *you sell to*, designed from what *you* sell?" Read it backwards and you produce a competitor teardown instead of an enrichment schema, having spent the research budget on the wrong company.

If the user is a Cargo-side operator designing this *for* a prospect, the same rule holds one level out: research the prospect, design attributes about the prospect's customers.

## Step 1 — Read what the workspace already knows (free)

Three lookups, no credits. Any of them can end the recipe early.

```bash
cargo-ai context runtime browse                      # ICP / persona / proof docs already written?
cargo-ai storage model list                          # which model holds accounts
cargo-ai storage model get-ddl <companies-model-uuid> # which columns already exist, and their types
cargo-ai segmentation segment list                   # what the team already slices on
```

If the context repo already carries an ICP doc, this recipe **extends** it rather than restating it — and the output goes back to the same place (Step 8). If a proposed attribute is already a populated column, it is not a proposal, it is a reporting gap; say so and move on.

## Step 2 — Research the seller from public sources, not from memory

Model recall about a company is stale, thin for anything under ~1,000 employees, and confidently wrong about pricing and positioning. Fetch the pages.

```bash
# Crawl the seller's own site — homepage, product, pricing, docs, customers, careers
cargo-ai orchestration action execute \
  --action '{"kind":"connector","integrationSlug":"firecrawl","actionSlug":"crawl"}' \
  --data '{"url":"https://<seller-domain>","limit":25}' --wait-until-finished

# Sourced answers for anything the site does not state (funding, category, named competitors)
cargo-ai orchestration action execute \
  --action '{"kind":"connector","integrationSlug":"linkup","actionSlug":"instruct"}' \
  --data '{"q":"Who does <seller> sell to, and who do they compete with?","depth":"standard","outputType":"sourcedAnswer"}' \
  --wait-until-finished
```

`instruct` takes `q` (a natural-language question) and a required `depth` — there is no implicit default, and `prompt` is not a field it accepts. See [`../provider-playbooks/linkup.md`](../provider-playbooks/linkup.md).

Read for the four things that actually generate attribute candidates — the homepage generates none of them:

| Page | What it tells you | Attribute it generates |
|---|---|---|
| **Pricing** | What a deal is worth, and what it scales on (seats, volume, entities, stores) | The unit the product is priced in is almost always the highest-value attribute — it *is* deal size |
| **Customer stories** | Who actually wins, in their own words | The shared conditions across logos; the "before" state each story describes is the pain to detect |
| **Docs / integrations** | Technical prerequisites | Compatibility attributes — what must already be in the stack for the product to install at all |
| **Careers** | What the seller is building next | Where the ICP is about to move; a role they are hiring for is a segment they intend to serve |

Cost: ~1–3 credits total. This is the cheapest step and it determines the quality of everything after it.

## Step 3 — Draft candidates against the discriminator test

For each candidate, ask the only question that matters: *given ten companies that already pass the standard firmographic filter, does this field tell me which one to work first?* If two companies with different values get the same treatment, cut it.

Split the candidates cleanly — the two feed different machinery downstream:

| | Attribute (state) | Signal (change) |
|---|---|---|
| Answers | What is true about this account? | Why is this account more relevant now than six months ago? |
| Example | 400 engineers; 12 countries; uses Salesforce | Engineering headcount +30% in 6 months; entered 3 new markets; migrating off HubSpot |
| Feeds | Scoring, tiering, territory design | Timing, triggers, sequence entry |
| Goes stale | Slowly — refresh on a cadence | Fast — has an expiry date |

"Uses AWS" is an attribute. "Started migrating to AWS" is a signal. A static fact dressed as a signal is the most common defect in this exercise, and it survives review because it reads urgent.

Two standing rules on the attribute side:

- **A generic firmographic earns its place only when it is unusually load-bearing** for this seller (founded-year for a remote-payroll product; entity count for a finance-automation product). Otherwise it is already in the CRM and gives no edge.
- **Aggregate, never dossier.** "Ratio of senior to junior engineers" as a company-level count is fine. The same question answered by profiling named individuals is not — see [`../references/acceptable-use.md`](../references/acceptable-use.md).

## Step 4 — The feasibility gate

Every surviving candidate gets an action slug and a price, or it gets cut. "Likely source: job postings" is not a source; `theirStack.searchJobs` at 0.5 credits per posting returned is.

A price here means **credits per account**, which for a row-billed action is not the same as the action's unit cost — see the third mechanic below the table.

| What you want to know | Cheapest catalog path | Credits/account | Coverage to expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Function headcount, seniority mix, SDR:AE ratio, eng-as-share-of-total | `salesNavigator.findEmployeesDistribution` (0.25 **+ 0.05 ID**), or `linkedin.findCustomHeadcount` (0.5) when the role you care about isn't one of the buckets — it counts by keyword | 0.25–0.5 **+ ID** | High where a LinkedIn company page exists |
| Headcount growth or decline | `salesNavigator.findCompanyMetrics` (0.25 **+ 0.05 ID**), or `companyEnrich.getWorkforce` (0.25 — historical headcount **by department**) | 0.25 | Medium–High |
| Revenue band, NAICS / industry codes | `companyEnrich.enrichByDomain` (0.25) — same call also returns employees, funding and socials, so it can fill several rows at once | 0.25 | Medium — banded, not exact; private companies are estimates |
| Tech stack | `builtwith.getDomainSummary` (**0**) first, then `builtwith.enrichDomain` (1, flat) or `theirStack.searchTechnologies` (0.5/row) | 0 to start; 1 flat, or **0.5 × rows** — cap with `limit` | Medium — detection favors client-side and vendor-declared tech; back-office tools are near-invisible |
| Hiring intent — which roles, how many, how recent | `theirStack.searchJobs` (0.5) or `linkedin.searchJobs` (0.5) | **0.5 × postings returned** — cap with `limit` | Medium–High |
| Funding, M&A | `enrichCrm.getFunding` | 1 | High for VC-backed, structurally absent for bootstrapped |
| Positioning or website change | `firecrawl.scrape` (0.05) → `anthropic.instruct` haiku (0.2), diffed against the stored copy | ~0.25 | Medium — needs a stored baseline, or there is nothing to diff |
| Stated challenges, competitive landscape | `firecrawl.scrape` (0.05) → `anthropic.instruct` (0.2), or `linkup.instruct` (1, sourced) | 0.25–1 | Medium |
| **Anything stated on one specific page** — trust center, store locator, supported currencies, integration directory, entity list | `firecrawl.scrape` (0.05) → `anthropic.instruct` haiku (0.2) | ~0.25 | Entirely determined by whether that page exists — probe it |
| A question no structured provider carries | `linkup.instruct` (1, sourced) or `perplexity.instruct` (0.3–1) | 0.3–1 | Always answers; whether it answers *correctly* is what the probe measures |
| Companies like these customers (lookalikes) | `aiArk.searchCompanies` with `lookalikeDomains` (0.01/row, ≤5 seeds), or `linkedin.extractSimilarCompanies` (0.25 flat). `companyEnrich.findSimilarCompanies` also exists but bills **1 per company returned** — `limit: 100` is 100 credits | 0.01 × rows, or 0.25 | Medium — seed quality decides everything; probe with 5 seeds before scaling |
| Who works at one domain you already hold | `icypeas.scanDomain` (0.1, role addresses only) or `hunter.searchDomain` (1, named people, **max 10/call**) | 0.1–1 | Medium — this is a per-account lookup, not a list builder; looping `searchDomain` is the documented pitfall |
| How this person is likely to buy (personality, selling notes) | `aiArk.analyzePersonality` (0.05) | 0.05 | Catalog-unique. An input to *how you write*, never a stored fact about the person |
| Review/category presence | `piloterr.getG2ProductInfo` (0.01), `g2.enrichProduct` (1) | 0.01–1 | Low–Medium, category-dependent |
| Employee ratings / employer reputation (Glassdoor-style) | **none** | — | No credits-based action in the catalog returns this. It is a research note, not a datapoint — say so rather than substituting a scrape that reads like the real thing |

The `firecrawl.scrape` → `anthropic.instruct` row is the workhorse of this recipe: it is how a company-specific attribute nobody sells — *does this company publish a SOC 2 badge? how many store locations does the locator list? which currencies does checkout accept?* — becomes a real column for about a quarter of a credit. Use [`../references/prompt-library/data-extraction.md`](../references/prompt-library/data-extraction.md) → `custom-attribute-extraction` for the extract step rather than writing the prompt fresh.

Two cost mechanics change the arithmetic. The first is an **ID prerequisite** — a per-account entry fee before the attribute's own price, and the most common reason a shortlist under-quotes:

- Every `salesNavigator.find*` action (`findEmployeesDistribution`, `findCompanyMetrics`, `findEmployeesCount`, `findCompanyInsights`) keys on a LinkedIn **`companyId`**, not a domain. Accounts sourced through `salesNavigator.searchAccounts` already carry it; a list that arrived from a CRM export or a domain column does not, and resolving it costs 0.05/account through `searchAccounts`. It amortizes across every `find*` attribute on the same account — but it is easy to miss, because these actions look self-contained.
- **Search-shaped actions bill per returned row; the `find*` actions do not.** `theirStack.searchJobs`, `salesNavigator.searchAccounts` / `searchLeads` / `extract*` charge for every record they return, so keep `limit` strict and size the pool with `limit: 1` first ([`../references/cost-discipline.md`](../references/cost-discipline.md) §4). The `salesNavigator.find*` calls above are flat per account regardless of what comes back — don't budget them per row.

That second mechanic is the one that breaks estimates quietly, because a row-billed action *looks* like a flat per-account price in a table. A hiring-velocity field over an account with 8 open postings costs 4 credits, not 0.5 — and the accounts with the most postings are exactly the high-growth ones the field exists to find, so the overrun concentrates on the rows you care about. `cost-discipline.md` uses this precise case as its worked example of an estimate missing by 2×. **Price a row-billed attribute as `unit cost × rows you will actually accept`, and set `limit` to that number** so the cap is enforced rather than hoped for. Step 5 is where you measure the multiplier.

Doing that arithmetic can also flip which provider is cheaper. Tech stack is the clearest case: `theirStack.searchTechnologies` at 0.5/row undercuts `builtwith.enrichDomain` at a flat 1 only while an account returns one technology. At three rows it is 1.5 — the flat action wins, and it wins by more on exactly the dense stacks worth scoring. Compare per-account totals, never unit prices.

Anything left with no row here is a research note, not a datapoint. Say that plainly in the deliverable — "valuable, no obtainable source" is a legitimate and useful line item, and it is the honest version of what the exercise usually pads with.

## Step 5 — Probe before you promise

Take 5–10 **representative** accounts (not the ten biggest — they are the best-covered and will flatter every candidate) and run each surviving candidate against them. Full mechanics in [`source-planning.md`](source-planning.md) §3.

Record only: hit rate, **cost per hit** (cost per row ÷ hit rate), correctness on 3 spot-checks, freshness — plus, for any row-billed action, **rows returned per account**. That last number is the multiplier the shortlist needs; without it a per-row price gets copied into the table as if it were per-account, which is the single most common way this arithmetic goes wrong. Take the *median and the max* across the probe, not the mean: the max is what a runaway account costs, and it is what `limit` has to cap. Kill any candidate whose cost-per-hit exceeds what the decision it drives is worth. A 0.25-credit attribute at 20% coverage costs 1.25 per answer and leaves 80% of the list `Unknown` — which is a worse input to a score than not having the column, because a null reads as a low value in every naive scoring model.

Budget for this step: roughly 30–80 credits for a 6–10 candidate shortlist at 10 accounts each — the Step 6 schema alone probes at ~46. Row-billed candidates dominate that range and are the reason it is a range at all, so probe them with `limit` already set to the cap you intend to ship; a probe run uncapped measures a cost you are not going to pay and hides the one you are.

## Step 6 — Present the shortlist, then wait

The deliverable is a costed table, not an essay. Present it and stay in AWAIT_APPROVAL — the fan-out behind it is the expensive part.

> **Schema for `<seller>` — 6 attributes, 3 signals survived of 17 candidates**
>
> | # | Field | Type | Source | Cost/acct | Probe hit | Refresh | Decision it changes |
> |---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
> | — | *LinkedIn `companyId`* | *prereq* | `salesNavigator.searchAccounts` — needed once for #1–#2 | 0.05 | 9/10 | Once | — |
> | 1 | `eng_headcount_est` | number | `salesNavigator.findEmployeesDistribution` | 0.25 | 9/10 | Monthly | Tier + seat-count estimate |
> | 2 | `has_platform_team` | boolean | same call, title parse | 0.00 | 9/10 | Monthly | Routes to the technical persona |
> | 3 | `soc2_status` | enum | `firecrawl.scrape` /security + extract | 0.25 | 6/10 | Quarterly | Kills or unlocks enterprise motion |
> | 4 | `ai_tool_state` | enum | `builtwith.getDomainSummary` (0) → `enrichDomain` on the residue | 1.00 | 4/10 | Quarterly | Displacement vs greenfield play |
> | 5 | `eng_hiring_velocity` | number | `theirStack.searchJobs`, `limit: 3` | 1.50 | 7/10 | Weekly | Timing — expansion in progress |
> | 6 | `workforce_trend_12mo` | enum | `companyEnrich.getWorkforce` | 0.25 | 6/10 | Monthly | Growing vs contracting account |
>
> #5 is **row-billed**: 0.5 per posting returned, and the probe found a median of 3 relevant postings per account (max 9). `limit: 3` is what turns that into the fixed 1.50 above — uncapped, the top decile of accounts would cost 4.50 each.
>
> **Cut, with reason:** exact competitor spend (no source at any price) · contract renewal date (not public) · "is growing" (not discriminating) · industry (already a column).
>
> **Full-list arithmetic:** 3.30 credits/account (1 prereq + 6 attributes) × 4,100 accounts = **~13,500 credits**. Balance is 12,000 — the full fan-out does not fit, which is the point of quoting it before running it.
> **Cheaper cut (recommended):** drop #4 and #6, the two quarterly/monthly enrichment rows → **~8,400 credits** (2.05/account), keeps 80% of the scoring signal. Neither carries an ID fee, so the saving here is exactly their own price — 1.25/account, no more.
> **Narrower cut:** run all 6 on the 900 accounts already in the Tier-1 segment → **~3,000 credits**.

Three shaped options, a default, the reconciled balance — the standard approval shape from [`../references/cost-discipline.md`](../references/cost-discipline.md).

Two things in that table are worth copying into your own version, because both are places the arithmetic silently stops reconciling:

- **Cutting an attribute can cut its ID fee too.** Dropping #4 and #6 saves exactly their own price, because neither needs an id. Dropping #1 *and* #2 would save more than theirs, because it also retires the 0.05 `companyId` prereq — while dropping only one of them retires nothing, since the other still needs it. Recompute the prereqs per option instead of subtracting attribute prices from the total.
- **A row-billed field needs its multiplier and its cap shown**, not just a number. `1.50` in a costed table is only true because `limit: 3` makes it true; without the cap, the same row is an open-ended price that lands hardest on the fastest-growing accounts.

That arithmetic is the whole reason the feasibility gate exists. Designing ten attributes is free. Filling ten attributes across a TAM is a four-figure credit line, and the user should see it before agreeing rather than after.

## Step 7 — Operationalize: columns, batch, score

An attribute that lives in a chat reply is a research note. Give it a column.

```bash
# One column per approved attribute
cargo-ai storage column create --model-uuid <companies-model-uuid> \
  --column '{"slug":"eng_headcount_est","type":"number","label":"Est. Engineering Headcount","kind":"custom"}'

# Inferred attributes get a companion confidence column — never store an inference bare
cargo-ai storage column create --model-uuid <companies-model-uuid> \
  --column '{"slug":"eng_headcount_est_confidence","type":"string","label":"Est. Eng Headcount — Confidence","kind":"custom"}'
```

Add the confidence companion only for attributes that are **inferred or estimated**, not for ones read directly off a page — one extra column per uncertain field, not a doubling of the schema.

Then fill them: pilot on 10–20 accounts, present the receipt, get approval, fan out. Standard batch mechanics in [`../guides/enriching-and-researching.md`](../guides/enriching-and-researching.md); retrieve with `run download-outputs`.

Scoring is where the schema earns out. Assign points per attribute band, and be explicit that `Unknown` scores **neutral, never zero** — a missing value is absence of evidence, and scoring it as a negative systematically buries every account with thin public presence, which correlates with size, not with fit.

## Step 8 — Refresh, or it dies

Stale custom data is worse than none: it looks authoritative and is wrong. Set the cadence from how fast the underlying thing can actually change.

| Attribute family | Cadence | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Job postings, hiring volume | Weekly | Scheduled play |
| Executive / leadership changes | Weekly | Scheduled play |
| Headcount, function distribution | Monthly | Scheduled play |
| Tech stack, certifications, entity counts | Quarterly | Scheduled play |
| Funding, M&A, market entry | Event-driven | `enrichCrm.getFunding` on a weekly sweep, diffed against the stored round date |

Turn each cadence into a play — [`save-as-play.md`](save-as-play.md). Before deploying, read the **Recurring use** section of the playbook for every paid node: a play re-bills its full node graph on every scheduled run.

Scope each play to the fields whose cadence is actually due. In the Step 6 schema the monthly-cadence fields are #1, #2, and #6 — 0.50 credits/account, so **~2,050 credits every month** across 4,100 accounts, not once.

Putting all six on one monthly play instead costs ~13,300/month and is wrong in both directions: #5 is a weekly field that a monthly sweep lets go stale, while #3 and #4 are quarterly ones it re-bills three times more often than they can change. One play per cadence, not one play per schema. The ID prereq is the one thing no refresh re-pays — once `companyId` is a column, every later run skips it, which is why the refresh rate (3.25/account) is below the first-fill rate (3.30).

**Do the annual arithmetic on the fastest field before you schedule it.** #5 at 1.50/account weekly across 4,100 accounts is ~6,200 credits *per week* — more than the entire first fill of every other field combined, and about 320,000 a year. Weekly cadence belongs on the segment where timing actually changes a decision (the 900 Tier-1 accounts, ~1,350/week), not on the full list. The cheapest version of a fast signal is a narrow audience, not a lower price.

**In Cargo, a live signal is a tracked column diff.** That is the mechanical link between Step 3's signal list and something that fires. Create the segment with the signal-bearing attributes as tracking columns, then read its delta feed:

```bash
cargo-ai segmentation segment create --name "ICP — signal watch" \
  --model-uuid <companies-model-uuid> \
  --filter '{"conjonction":"and","groups":[{"conjonction":"and","conditions":[
    {"kind":"string","columnSlug":"icp_tier","operator":"is","values":["tier-1","tier-2"]}
  ]}]}' \
  --tracking-column-slugs "eng_headcount_est,ai_tool_state,soc2_status"

cargo-ai segmentation change list --segment-uuid <segment-uuid>
cargo-ai segmentation change fetch --uuid <change-uuid> --kinds updated
```

Three flag traps in those four lines, each of which fails quietly or with a bare 400:

- **Conditions live inside `groups`, never beside them.** `{"conjonction":"and","groups":[]}` is the match-everything filter, so a top-level `conditions` array is ignored and the segment silently becomes the whole model — with the tracking and refresh spend that implies.
- **The spelling is `conjonction`.** Misspelled, it matches nothing without erroring.
- **`change fetch` takes `--uuid`** — the *change* UUID from `change list`, not the segment UUID — plus a required `--kinds`. See [`../../cargo-segmentation/SKILL.md`](../../cargo-segmentation/SKILL.md).

And `updatedRecordsCount` stays `0` unless `--tracking-column-slugs` was set **at creation** — the single most common way this whole motion silently produces nothing.

For volume-level watching ("tell me when more than 5 accounts pick up the signal this week"), add a model-scoped alert with a filter — [`../../cargo-observability/SKILL.md`](../../cargo-observability/SKILL.md). Preview it before creating it.

## Evidence rules

These are not stylistic. Each one prevents a specific wrong answer that scores well.

**Technology usage is not a boolean.** One engineer's profile, one job posting, and a company-wide mandate are different facts. Store the state, not `true`:

`company_standard` · `approved_tool` · `team_usage` · `individual_usage` · `pilot_or_evaluation` · `historical` · `none_found` · `unknown`

A single job posting establishes `individual_usage` at best — and a tool listed under "nice to have" establishes nothing at all. Use [`../references/prompt-library/data-extraction.md`](../references/prompt-library/data-extraction.md) → `technology-adoption-state` to classify the evidence rather than eyeballing it.

**Confidence is a band, and `Unknown` is a valid answer.** Confirmed (explicit, current, authoritative source) · Inferred (several consistent indirect sources, no contradiction) · Estimated (calculated from partial public data — numeric fields only) · Unknown (insufficient or contradictory). The first three are all storable, tagged with the band that produced them; anything that reaches none of them returns `Unknown` rather than a value — an unsupported assertion in a scoring column is a decision made on noise, and it is invisible once the value is written. `Estimated` means arithmetic on figures you actually have, not a plausible-sounding number.

**Store the evidence with the value** for anything above trivial cost. A quoted phrase and its URL in the companion column is what makes the value auditable six months later, and it is the difference between a rep trusting the field and ignoring it.

**Known false positives to name in the deliverable:** duplicated or stale job postings inflating hiring counts; leadership changes that carry no budget; funding earmarked for something unrelated; technology mentions that are historical; repository activity from a two-person open-source side project.

## First-party datapoints: separate list, separate model

Product usage, activation, billing history, and renewal risk are **unavailable for net-new accounts by definition** — a prospect has never logged in. Keep them out of the net-new schema entirely, and list them separately if they come up: they are excellent inputs to an *expansion* or *health* score over accounts that already exist ([`account-expansion.md`](account-expansion.md)), and mixing them into a prospecting score silently ranks customers above prospects.

**Website-visitor identification is not in that group.** `snitcher` de-anonymizes the companies browsing the seller's site, and most of them are cold — [`../provider-playbooks/snitcher.md`](../provider-playbooks/snitcher.md) calls identified visitors "the warmest cold segment there is" and files them in the SIGNAL stage beside job-change and funding. It belongs in a net-new schema. What it *isn't* is a sourceable attribute: you cannot fill it across a 4,100-account TAM, because it only exists for accounts that already visited. So it fails Step 4's gate on a different axis than the fields above — not "no source at any price" but **arrival-driven**, and only if the seller runs Snitcher's tracking script on their own site.

Treat it accordingly: a `last_seen` / `pages_viewed` column populated by the extractors, scored as a timing signal on the accounts that have it, and neutral (never negative) on the ones that don't — the same `Unknown`-scores-neutral rule as everywhere else, and the reason it can coexist with a sourced schema instead of skewing it. Watch the cost shape too: `searchSessions` is free, but the `fetchOrganisations` extractor bills **3 credits per identified company on every sync**, which is the most expensive line in this recipe if it is switched on for a high-traffic site without sizing the traffic first.

## Deliverable

What the user gets at the end: the costed shortlist table from Step 6, the cut list with reasons, the refresh cadence per field, and — once approved and filled — the columns, the segment, and the play. Write the schema itself back to the context repo so the next person inherits the reasoning instead of re-deriving it:

```bash
cargo-ai context runtime write --path icp/account-attributes.md \
  --content '<the schema, its sources, probed hit rates, and the cut list>' \
  --commit-message "Add custom account attribute schema"
```

The cut list is the most valuable half of that document. "We tested competitor-spend detection and there is no source at any price" saves the next person the same two days.
