# Credits cost table

Every credits-based action Cargo can run — 176 of the 513 actions exposed by 123 of the catalog's 136 integrations, plus Cargo's own native actions — sorted by cost. The other 337 carry no *provider* price; they are not free, because every node execution bills 0.01 credits (1 per 100) regardless. See [`../../cargo-billing/SKILL.md`](../../cargo-billing/SKILL.md) → "The execution charge".

Rows whose provider is `native` are Cargo's own platform actions, run as `{"kind":"native","actionSlug":"<action>"}` with no integration; every other row runs as `{"kind":"connector","integrationSlug":"<provider>","actionSlug":"<action>"}`.

**Generated. Do not edit by hand** — this is a snapshot of the live catalog, which is where pricing actually lives. Regenerate from `action list`, which returns a `credits` array on every billed action:

```sh
cargo-ai orchestration action list --kind connector
cargo-ai orchestration action list --kind native
```

Omit `--limit` so both return the full set, then render one row per action. Each `credits` entry is one of three shapes: `fixed` bills `cost` per call; `unit` bills `cost` per `unit` consumed; `package` bills `cost` per block of `unitsCount` `unit`. For `unit` and `package`, `fixedCost` is a base charge that **adds to** the metered rate rather than replacing it — a search billed `0.175` `fixedCost` + `0.025` per item costs `0.2` for one item. Several entries mean the price depends on config, and each entry's `config.jsonSchema` const/enum is what selects it; those go in the per-config section at the end rather than the main table.
