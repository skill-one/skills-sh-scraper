# Production Crash & Hang Triage (Sentry / ASC)

Use this skill when you have a **corpus** of grouped production issues from an aggregator (Sentry, App Store Connect) and need to classify, cluster, and prioritize them. This is the corpus-level path — not for a single local crash file.

- **Single crash file** (.ips, MetricKit, .crash) → `axiom-shipping (skills/testflight-triage.md)` or `/axiom:analyze-crash`
- **TestFlight triage via Xcode Organizer** → `axiom-shipping (skills/testflight-triage.md)`
- **This skill** → Sentry unresolved issues list, ASC aggregated crash signatures, dozens-to-hundreds of grouped issues

## The pipeline

The Go side (`xcsym triage`) is a network-free pure function. It reads NormalizedReport JSONL on stdin and writes a TriageResult JSON to stdout. The LLM owns all provider auth, fetch, normalization, and semantic merging.

**The command:**

```bash
# File argument form
xcsym triage --latest-version 2.1.1 --os-floor 18.0 --min-users 5 corpus.jsonl

# Stdin form (both work)
xcsym triage --latest-version 2.1.1 --os-floor 18.0 --min-users 5 < corpus.jsonl
```

All three flags are optional. Omit any you don't need; threshold-based noise rules are silently disabled when the corresponding flag is absent.

No dSYMs required. No Xcode CLT symbolication. No network calls. Pass the JSONL, get a TriageResult.

## Fetching from Sentry

**Token:** Locate a token — never ask the user to paste one, never commit it, never log it, never include it in output. Lookup order:

1. `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable
2. `[auth] token` in `~/.sentryclirc`, then a project-local `.sentryclirc`
3. Ask the user where their token lives (a path or env-var name — not the value)

**Verify scope before the corpus fetch.** Finding *a* token is not finding a *usable* one: reading issues needs `event:read` (+ `project:read`), and `.sentryclirc` tokens are often CI tokens scoped `org:ci` (symbol uploads only) that cannot read issues at all. One cheap probe turns "confusing partial failure" into "wrong token":

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://sentry.io/api/0/projects/{org_slug}/{proj_slug}/issues/?limit=1"
# 200 → usable for triage · 401/403 → wrong or under-scoped token; say so and stop
```

### List unresolved issues

```
GET https://sentry.io/api/0/projects/{org_slug}/{proj_slug}/issues/?query=is:unresolved&limit=100
Authorization: Bearer $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN
```

**Do not pass `statsPeriod=90d`, `30d`, or `7d` — the endpoint rejects them with 400.** Its documented set is only `""`, `24h`, and `14d`. Omit the parameter for the unbounded default; use `14d` when a stats window is wanted. If a 400 still comes back, the response's `detail` string lists the currently-valid choices — read it and retry with one of those rather than guessing. Add `environment=production` when needed. `limit=100` is the documented maximum; smaller pages only multiply round trips.

### Cursor pagination — mandatory

Sentry pages with cursor-based links at your `limit` (100 max). An active app with dozens of unresolved issues will span many pages. Fetching only the first page and calling it a corpus is a correctness failure — it silently drops the majority of issues.

**Algorithm:**

1. Fetch the first page.
2. Read the `Link:` response header. It contains two entries separated by `,`:
   ```
   <https://sentry.io/api/0/...?cursor=X>; rel="previous"; results="false",
   <https://sentry.io/api/0/...?cursor=Y>; rel="next"; results="true"
   ```
3. If `rel="next"` has `results="true"`, extract its URL and fetch the next page. If `results="false"`, the cursor is exhausted — stop.
4. Accumulate results across all pages.
5. **Always log the page count** when done: `"Fetched N pages (M total issues)"`. If you hit a cap you imposed (e.g., 20-page max), state it explicitly: `"Cap hit at page 20 — corpus is partial; some issues not included."` A partial corpus is not an error, but it must be announced, never silent.

Cap example (for very large projects): stop at 20 pages and announce the cap. The user can re-run with tighter filters.

### Rank from the list payload; fetch event bodies only where needed

The list response already carries what the ranking pass needs per issue: `culprit`, `count`, `userCount`, `metadata` (`function`, `type`, `value`), `firstSeen`/`lastSeen`. Cluster and rank the whole corpus from the paginated list alone — do **not** make a per-issue request for every row (100+ round trips where a handful suffice). Two caveats — the first measured on a real corpus:

- **`culprit` is not universally populated** (empty on ~40% of one corpus), and `metadata.function` tends to be absent on exactly the App Hang issues. Fall back to `metadata.type` + `metadata.value`. Never present the empty-culprit set as a single family — treat it the way the family-merge step treats a `|sys:` bag: split it.
- **`xcsym triage` classifies at full confidence only with frames.** Fetch event bodies for the issues you will analyze in depth — the top families by users, every hang candidate, anything ambiguous — and emit the rest as minimal reports (`frames_unavailable: true`), which classify by exception code at reduced confidence and still appear in the report (flag-never-hide).

For each issue that needs frames, fetch its most recent event:

```
GET https://sentry.io/api/0/issues/{issue_id}/events/latest/
Authorization: Bearer $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN
```

From the response, extract:

| Sentry field | NormalizedReport field |
|---|---|
| `id` (issue) | `issue_id` |
| `permalink` | `issue_url` |
| `title` | `title` |
| Issue type "App Hanging" / "App Hang" | `kind: "hang"` (else `"crash"`) |
| `userCount` | `impact.users` |
| `count` (events) | `impact.events` |
| `firstSeen`, `lastSeen` | `impact.first_seen`, `impact.last_seen` |
| `tags.release` (single value — see below) | `versions.affected`, `versions.min`, `versions.max` |
| `tags.os.version` (single value — see below) | `os.versions`; `tags.os.name` → `os.platform` |
| `entries[type=exception].values[0].type` | `exception.type` |
| `entries[type=exception].values[0].mechanism.meta.signal.name` | `exception.signal` |
| `entries[type=exception].values[0].mechanism.meta.mach_exception.exception_name` | `exception.mach_exception` |
| `entries[type=threads].values` or `entries[type=exception].values[0].stacktrace` | `threads[]` |

**Frames:** Sentry frames are **bottom-up** (outermost frame first). Reverse them to get top-down (crashed frame first), matching the NormalizedReport convention. For each frame: `module`/`package` → `image`, `function` → `symbol`, `inApp` → `in_app`.

**`crashed_thread`:** Set to the index of the thread marked `crashed: true`. If ambiguous, use 0 (main thread). The adapter uses this to set `RawCrash.CrashedIdx` — every rule that inspects the crashed thread depends on it.

### `tags` on an event is one value per key, not a distribution

An **event** payload's `tags` is an array of `{key, value}` objects with exactly **one value per key**. The array is the list — the values are not. So `tags.release` from `events/latest/` is the release of that single (most recent) event, and `tags.os.version` is one OS version. Neither is the issue's affected-version set.

This matters because two noise rules threshold on those fields:

| Rule | Reads | Failure if fed a one-event sample |
|---|---|---|
| `noise.fixed_in_newer.v1` | `versions.max` | "Highest affected version predates latest shipped" is decided from one event's release |
| `noise.single_os_eol.v1` | `os.versions` | "All affected OS versions are below the floor" is decided from one OS version — a single iOS 17 event does not mean no iOS 18 users |

**Do not populate `versions.affected` / `versions.min` / `os.versions` as if they were distributions when your only source is an event body.** A single value cannot be a min, a max, and an affected-set at once. Populate `versions.max` only, leave the rest empty, and treat both rules' output accordingly.

To make either rule sound you need the group-level distribution, which is a separate request per issue:

```
GET https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/{org}/issues/{issue_id}/tags/release/values/
GET https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/{org}/issues/{issue_id}/tags/os.version/values/
```

This is a **deliberate, scoped exception** to the no-N+1 rule above — spend it only on the issues you will actually threshold (those where `--latest-version` or `--os-floor` is in play), never on the whole corpus. The issue-list payload carries no release fields, so there is no cheaper source. If you skip the extra request, say so in the report rather than presenting either flag as a measured fact.

## Fetching from App Store Connect

Use `asc-mcp` tools when available:

| Task | asc-mcp tool |
|---|---|
| List crash signatures for a build | `metrics_build_diagnostics` |
| Download crash log detail | `metrics_get_diagnostic_logs` |

ASC crash aggregates sometimes lack individual-event frame data. When frames are unavailable, emit a **minimal NormalizedReport** with `frames_unavailable: true`:

```json
{ "provider": "asc", "issue_id": "...", "title": "...", "kind": "crash",
  "impact": { "users": 12, "events": 30 }, "frames_unavailable": true,
  "exception": { "mach_exception": "0x8badf00d" }, "threads": [] }
```

The `triage` subcommand classifies minimal reports using exception codes only (reduced confidence) rather than skipping them. Document the reduced confidence in the triage report.

## NormalizedReport shape

One JSON object per line (JSONL). Each line is one grouped issue.

**Full example — hang (idle runloop):**

```json
{
  "provider": "sentry",
  "issue_id": "ACME-3V",
  "issue_url": "https://sentry.io/organizations/acme/issues/ACME-3V/",
  "title": "CFRunLoopRunSpecific",
  "kind": "hang",
  "impact": { "users": 68, "events": 412, "first_seen": "2026-05-01", "last_seen": "2026-06-05" },
  "versions": { "affected": ["2.1.0", "2.1.1"], "min": "2.1.0", "max": "2.1.1" },
  "os": { "platform": "iOS", "versions": ["18.4", "26.0"] },
  "crashed_thread": 0,
  "threads": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "crashed": true,
      "frames": [
        { "image": "libsystem_kernel.dylib", "symbol": "mach_msg2_trap", "offset": 8, "in_app": false },
        { "image": "CoreFoundation", "symbol": "CFRunLoopRun", "offset": 1234, "in_app": false }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Hang events do not carry an `exception` or `termination` block — those fields are optional and omitted here. The `0xdead10cc` code (data-protection violation) belongs on `kind: "crash"` reports, not hangs.

**Full example — crash (data-protection violation, 0xdead10cc):**

```json
{
  "provider": "sentry",
  "issue_id": "ACME-7B",
  "issue_url": "https://sentry.io/organizations/acme/issues/ACME-7B/",
  "title": "GRDB.DatabaseError: disk I/O error",
  "kind": "crash",
  "impact": { "users": 22, "events": 89, "first_seen": "2026-05-10", "last_seen": "2026-06-04" },
  "versions": { "affected": ["2.1.1"], "min": "2.1.1", "max": "2.1.1" },
  "os": { "platform": "iOS", "versions": ["18.4"] },
  "exception": { "mach_exception": "0xdead10cc" },
  "termination": { "namespace": "RUNNINGBOARD", "code": "0xdead10cc" },
  "crashed_thread": 1,
  "threads": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "crashed": false,
      "frames": [
        { "image": "libsystem_kernel.dylib", "symbol": "mach_msg2_trap", "offset": 8, "in_app": false }
      ]
    },
    {
      "index": 1,
      "crashed": true,
      "frames": [
        { "image": "GRDB", "symbol": "DatabaseQueue.write", "offset": 44, "in_app": true },
        { "image": "MyApp", "symbol": "HistoryStore.flush", "offset": 12, "in_app": true }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Minimal example (ASC, frames unavailable):**

```json
{ "provider": "asc", "issue_id": "ASC-001", "kind": "crash",
  "impact": { "users": 12, "events": 30 }, "frames_unavailable": true,
  "exception": { "mach_exception": "0x8badf00d" }, "threads": [] }
```

**Key points:**

- `kind` is `"crash"` or `"hang"`. The `triage` subcommand accepts both; `xcsym crash` continues to reject hangs.
- `crashed_thread` is the `index` value of the crashed thread — 0 for main thread. This is not an array position; the adapter resolves it.
- Thread objects carry no `name` field. The main thread is identified by `index: 0`; Sentry thread names are not mapped.
- `in_app` per frame is the primary app-vs-system signal. It comes from Sentry's `inApp`. Do not derive it from image-name substrings when the provider already supplies it.
- `mach_exception` carries the hex code (`0xdead10cc`, `0x8badf00d`). The adapter normalizes it to lowercase `0x…` form before matching rules — uppercase input is handled automatically.
- Frames are **top-down** in NormalizedReport (index 0 = top of stack, closest to the crash).

## Reading the TriageResult

`xcsym triage` emits a single compact JSON object to stdout:

```json
{
  "tool": "xcsym", "subcommand": "triage", "version": "...",
  "summary": { "total": 70, "crashes": 51, "hangs": 19, "skipped": 0,
               "clusters": 11, "flagged_noise": 23, "candidate_families": 6 },
  "issues": [...],
  "clusters": [...],
  "errors": [...]
}
```

### Per-issue fields

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pattern_tag` | Crash/hang category from the rule engine (see table below) |
| `pattern_confidence` | `high`, `heuristic`, or `low` — how certain the crash/hang rule engine is (`heuristic` = pattern matched but evidence is indirect) |
| `pattern_rule_id` | The classification rule that fired (e.g., `R-swift-unwrap-01`, `H-idle-runloop-01`) |
| `cluster_key` | Mechanical signature grouping this issue with similar ones |
| `cluster_confidence` | `high` = top app frames; `low` = system-frame fallback (treat as a bag, not a cluster) |
| `noise_flags` | Array of `{class, rule_id, deprioritize_safety, reason}` — empty means real-bug candidate |
| `enrichment` | Cross-skill pointers (e.g., axiom-data for 0xdead10cc + DB frames). **Omitted** when no enrichment applies — i.e. on most issues |
| `top_frames` | Top 5 frames of the crashed thread, as `"image symbol"` strings. **Omitted** when the crashed thread has no frames — e.g. an ASC aggregate emitted with `frames_unavailable: true` and no `threads[]`. Don't expect it on every issue |

`pattern_rule_id` and `noise_flags[].rule_id` are two separate fields at different nesting levels. `pattern_rule_id` (top-level on each issue) names the classification rule that matched the crash/hang pattern. Each element of `noise_flags[]` carries its own `rule_id` naming the noise rule that fired (e.g., `noise.anr_suspension.v1`). Do not conflate them.

Every field named `*_confidence` rates **evidence strength**: `pattern_confidence` is `high`, `heuristic`, or `low` (crash/hang engine); `cluster_confidence` is `high` or `low`.

`noise_flags[].deprioritize_safety` is the one that is **not** a confidence, which is why it is not named like one. It rates **how safe acting on the flag is** — `high`, `medium`, or `low` — not how well the predicate matched. A rule can match exactly and still emit `low` when what it matched does not license the conclusion. `anr_suspension_false_positive` is the case in point: strict matcher, unsupported inference from shape to harmless.

### Noise-class table

| class | Meaning | Deprioritize safety | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `anr_suspension_false_positive` | Idle-runloop hang — shape is *consistent with* background suspension | medium | Demote to the review section, never close on shape alone — real watchdog-terminated hangs in system callouts share this exact signature (see the standing note) |
| `fixed_in_newer_build` | `versions.max` predates `--latest-version` — may already be fixed | low | Demote pending verification against the latest build — fires on most of the corpus mid-rollout, and its standing note can invert to *escalate* |
| `third_party_or_system_only` | Crashed thread is non-main and has zero `in_app` frames — may not be directly actionable | low | Demote cautiously; a third-party SDK can crash on a value your code passed it |
| `single_os_eol` | All affected OS versions are below `--os-floor` | medium | Deprioritize for supported users |
| `long_tail_low_impact` | `impact.users` is below `--min-users` | high | Rank low, not hidden |

**`noise_flags: []`** means no noise rules fired → the issue is a real-bug candidate.

### Hang-specific pattern tags

| pattern_tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `anr_idle_runloop` | Main thread parked in run loop with no app work — consistent with background suspension |
| `anr_main_thread_block` | Main thread in app code or a known blocking syscall — a real block |

An `anr_idle_runloop` issue is highly likely to carry `anr_suspension_false_positive` noise. When it doesn't (e.g., the main thread has a blocking syscall buried in the window), take it seriously.

## Semantic family-merge

The `cluster_key` is a mechanical, exact-signature grouping. High-confidence clusters are conservative by design — they never over-merge; `cluster_confidence: low` (`|sys:`) keys are flagged bags, not merges. The agent's job is to merge mechanical clusters that share a root cause and to split bags.

**Merge strategy:**

1. Read `cluster_key`, `cluster_confidence`, `pattern_tag`, and `top_frames` together for each cluster.
2. Merge clusters when: same `pattern_tag` + overlapping `top_frames` + plausible shared root cause (e.g., two nil-unwrap clusters that differ only in call site).
3. **Split `cluster_confidence: low` (marked `|sys:`) bags.** A system-frame fallback cluster lumps together unrelated issues under the same top syscall. Inspect individual `top_frames` and `pattern_tag` to split into real families. Do not present a `|sys:` cluster as a single coherent crash family.
4. Seed merges with the full frame list in `top_frames`, not just `cluster_key`.
5. To test whether a family involves a vendored SPM package, grep its **source filenames**, not the package or library name — statically linked packages surface as app-binary frames carrying the package's filenames, so the package name never appears (see testflight-triage, Reading the Stack Trace).

## Flag-never-hide reporting rule

**This rule is non-negotiable.** The final triage report must include every issue — noise-flagged or not.

**Structure:**

1. **Top real-bug families** — clusters with no noise flags, ranked by `total_users` descending. Include `pattern_tag`, root-cause hypothesis, enrichment pointers, and recommended next step.
2. **Deprioritized as likely noise (review before closing)** — a dedicated section listing every noise-flagged issue with:
   - Issue ID and title
   - `noise_flags[].class`, `noise_flags[].deprioritize_safety`, and `noise_flags[].reason`
   - User/event impact (so the reader can judge independently)

   Sort this section **least-safe first** — `low`, then `medium`, then `high` `deprioritize_safety`, breaking ties by users descending. The reader is scanning for what they are about to wrongly close, and that is at the top of the safety order, not the bottom.
3. **Skipped (malformed or unclassifiable)** — `errors[]` from the TriageResult, if any.

**No `deprioritize_safety` value licenses closing an issue.** `high` means the deprioritization is comparatively safe, not that the issue is dead. Every row in this section is *review before closing*, `high` rows included — the Action column of the noise-class table, not the safety value, says what may be done.

**`summary.candidate_families` counts only issues with zero noise flags**, regardless of how safe those flags were. A `low`-safety flag removes an issue from that count exactly as a `high` one does, so the number is a floor on real-bug families, not an estimate of them. Never report it as "we found N real bugs."

**Never omit a noise-flagged issue from the report.** Omission is the correctness failure this architecture is designed to prevent — in one real triage run the #1 issue by user count was an idle-runloop suspension false-positive. A tool that silently buried it would commit the same error inverted.

**Standing note for `third_party_or_system_only`:** Always include this caveat when listing third-party-only issues as deprioritized: "A third-party SDK can crash on a nil or invalid value passed by app code — zero app frames on the crashed thread does not rule out an app-side root cause. Check for app code on other threads or higher in the call chain before dismissing."

**Standing note for `anr_suspension_false_positive`:** "Idle-runloop shape says suspension is *likely* — it cannot say the hang was harmless. A watchdog-terminated fatal hang inside a system callout (UIScene, CoreUI, objc-runtime culprits) carries this exact signature while being a real, fixable block, and no cheap stack-shape signal separates the two: `culprit` and frame origin fail in both directions on measured real hangs, and in SwiftUI apps the `App.$main` frame is always in-app, keeping the app-vs-system frame mix "mixed" on essentially every issue, so that signal carries no information. 'Was the app actively running when captured' is usually not recoverable from the report itself — discriminate with MetricKit instead: `MXHangDiagnostic` call trees for the hang, and `MXAppExitMetric` watchdog-exit counts to see whether users are actually being terminated. If the issue keeps growing across releases, treat it as real regardless of shape."

**Standing note for `fixed_in_newer_build`:** "A version split is rollout-exposure-blind — most events sitting on the older build is the normal shape of an incomplete rollout, not proof the bug is fixed. Before closing, verify it actually stopped on the latest build: are there still events there, and is the per-user rate flat-at-zero or *rising* as adoption grows? A flag that fired only because the newest version has little exposure yet, while crashes climb on it, is a live bug — escalate, don't close. Confirm a code change actually touched the crashing path between the two versions."

## Resolving after triage (if you close issues in Sentry)

The pipeline ends at the ranked report — it resolves nothing. When you do close an issue, scope the resolution to a release: a bare `{"status":"resolved"}` leaves it unscoped, so the next straggler event from a still-installed broken build reopens it as a "regression" that reads exactly like the fix having failed.

**Closing issues does not move the crash-free rate.** Release Health computes crash-free sessions/users from session envelopes the SDK sends; issue `status` is a workflow field on the issue stream, and nothing connects the two. Bulk-resolving N issues changes the board from 70 rows to 47 and changes the metric by zero. When someone asks you to close issues to improve the number before a demo or review, that is the fact to lead with — the request does not achieve its own goal, which settles it faster than any argument about correctness.

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status":"resolved","statusDetails":{"inRelease":"<pkg>@<ver>+<build>"}}' \
  "https://sentry.io/api/0/issues/<numericID>/"
```

Re-read the issue afterward to confirm the status actually changed — the PUT's own echo is not proof it applied.

**When you want the row off the board but have not verified a fix, archive — do not resolve.** This is the honest instrument for every noise-flagged issue, and it is what to reach for instead of closing under pressure:

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status":"ignored","statusDetails":{"ignoreUntilEscalating":true}}' \
  "https://sentry.io/api/0/issues/<numericID>/"
```

`archived_until_escalating` clears the default unresolved stream while asserting only "not working this now" — never the false claim "this is fixed" — and Sentry resurfaces it on its own if volume climbs. Resolving an issue that is still taking events instead flips it back as a `regressed` substatus, so a close under deadline pressure tends to reappear as a fresh regression at the worst moment.

## Xcode 27 Organizer Overlap `OS27`

The Xcode 27 Organizer adds a redesigned Overview, Metric Goals calibrated against similar apps, and an agentic "Generate Recommendations" flow whose hang-fix suggestions overlap this skill's triage territory — useful as a second opinion on hang families surfaced here. Details live in axiom-performance (skills/performance-profiling.md, "Instruments 27 & Xcode 27 Organizer"); don't duplicate them into the triage pipeline.
