## Description: <br>
DINO (DETR with Improved DeNoising Anchor Boxes) for 2D object detection — a transformer-based detector with denoising training, multi-scale features, and optional distillation support for training, evaluating, exporting, distilling, quantizing, or running inference with TAO. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers training, evaluating, exporting, distilling, quantizing, or running inference for NVIDIA TAO DINO 2D object detectors using docker and nvidia-container-toolkit. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
1 evaluation task (1 positive), evaluated locally with evaluator version 1.3.2. Dataset digest: sha256:a0a4e58efb79. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill is safe to use — checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Whether the skill produces correct answers against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the right skill was found and executed when needed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helps complete the user's goal (goal completion and expected workflow adherence). <br>
- Efficiency: Whether the skill avoids wasted tool or skill usage — routing quality and productive tool use. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was found and executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Routing quality, workspace-aware skill reads, and productive tool use. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
