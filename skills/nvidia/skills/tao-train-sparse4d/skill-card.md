## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
1 evaluation task (1 positive) from skill-evaluator-dataset-snapshot/1. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Verifies final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the expected skill was found and executed when needed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the user's goal and expected workflow. <br>
- Efficiency: Routing quality, workspace-aware skill reads, and productive tool use. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was found and executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Routing quality, workspace-aware skill reads, and productive tool use. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
