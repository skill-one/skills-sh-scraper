# Replicas (in-workspace CLI)

This guide covers how to take action *with* Replicas itself from inside a Replicas workspace — managing automations, environments (and their variables/files), repos, previews, and the user's `replicas.json` config — using the pre-installed `replicas` CLI.

When the user asks _about_ Replicas (concepts, pricing, how a feature works), check https://docs.replicas.dev first. When the user asks you to _do_ something in their Replicas org, this is the file to use.

## Prerequisites

The CLI is pre-installed in every workspace and pre-authenticated using the workspace's engine secret. You do **not** need to log in or set an API key. Verify:

```bash
replicas whoami
```

Expected output (in agent mode):

```
Workspace identity:
  Workspace ID:    <uuid>
  Organization ID: <uuid>
```

If you get "Not logged in", the workspace is misconfigured — surface this to the user instead of trying to work around it.

In agent mode the CLI hides commands that don't make sense for in-workspace agents (`login`, `logout`, `codex-auth`, `claude-auth`, `org switch`, `config`, `interact`, `code`, replica/workspace top-level CRUD). What you have is:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `replicas whoami` | Print the workspace + org identity |
| `replicas init` | Create a `replicas.json` / `replicas.yaml` in the current directory |
| `replicas connect <name>` | SSH into another workspace (requires user creds — usually only useful when scripting locally) |
| `replicas repos` | List repos connected to the org |
| `replicas environment ...` | Manage environments, env vars, env files |
| `replicas automation ...` | Manage automations (cron + GitHub event triggers) |
| `replicas preview ...` | Register / list preview URLs (covered in `PREVIEWS.md`) |
| `replicas media ...` | Upload screenshots, videos, audio (covered in `MEDIA.md`) |

`replicas <command> --help` is always the source of truth for flags.

## Picking the right command for the user's request

| User says... | Run |
| --- | --- |
| "What environments do I have?" | `replicas environment list` |
| "Add API key X to my staging env" | `replicas environment vars set <env> <KEY> <VALUE>` |
| "Make me a `.env` file in the workspace with these vars" | `replicas environment files set <env> .env --content "..."` |
| "Create a new env for my `acme/web` repo" | `replicas environment create <name> -r acme/web` |
| "What automations do I have?" | `replicas automation list` |
| "Run my nightly automation now" | `replicas automation run <id>` |
| "Make an automation that runs every weekday at 9am" | `replicas automation create` (interactive) or `--trigger-cron "0 9 * * 1-5"` |
| "Make an automation that runs when a PR opens on `acme/web`" | `replicas automation create ... --trigger-github pull_request.opened --trigger-github-repos acme/web` |
| "What repos are connected?" | `replicas repos` |
| "Set up a `replicas.json` in this repo" | `replicas init` (`-y` for YAML) |

## Environments

Environments are the org-scoped *primitives* workspaces are built from. Each environment can bind to one repository (or repository set), carry environment variables, project files, enabled skills, and MCP servers. The `Global` environment is special — its vars/files/skills/MCPs apply to *every* workspace in the org, but it has no repo binding and can't back a workspace on its own.

### List / get / create / edit / delete

```bash
replicas environment list
replicas environment get <id-or-name>          # use "global" for the Global env
replicas environment create [name] \
  --description "..." \
  --repository <repo-name-or-id> \
  --system-prompt "..."
replicas environment edit <id-or-name> \
  --name "..." --description "..." \
  --repository <repo-name-or-id>          # pass empty string to unbind
replicas environment delete <id-or-name> [--force]
```

Notes:
- Environments resolve by **name or UUID**. `global` is an alias for the org's Global env.
- Non-global envs need a repo (or repo set) to back a workspace. If you `create` without `--repository`, the CLI prompts; in non-interactive contexts pass `-r`.
- `edit` on the Global env is rejected by the API — manage its contents through the `vars` / `files` subcommands instead.

### Environment variables

```bash
replicas environment vars list <env>
replicas environment vars set <env> <KEY> <VALUE>     # upsert (create or update)
replicas environment vars delete <env> <KEY|VARIABLE_ID> [--force]
```

`vars set` is upsert: if a variable with that key already exists, it's updated; otherwise created. The CLI accepts either the variable's `key` or its UUID for `delete`.

These variables are injected into every workspace built from this environment as actual `env` vars — perfect for API keys, feature flags, etc. Anything you want available to the agent's tools (Claude, codex, your code, etc.) goes here.

### Environment files

Files materialize on the workspace filesystem when a workspace starts, at the destination path you specify. Use this for things like `.env` files at the repo root, dotfiles in `~`, prompt files for agents, etc.

```bash
replicas environment files list <env>
replicas environment files set <env> <destination-path> --content "..."        # inline
replicas environment files set <env> <destination-path> --file <local-path>    # from local file
replicas environment files set <env> <destination-path> --file <local-path> --name "Friendly name"
replicas environment files delete <env> <destination-path|FILE_ID> [--force]
```

Constraints:
- Each file is capped at 64KB.
- `set` is upsert (matched by destination path).
- The display `--name` defaults to the basename of the destination path; override only if it would be unclear in the dashboard list.

## Automations

Automations are saved prompts with one or more triggers (cron schedules and/or GitHub events). When fired, they create a workspace using the configured environment and run the prompt with the user's coding agent.

### List / get / run / delete

```bash
replicas automation list
replicas automation get <id>
replicas automation run <id>          # cron-triggered automations only
replicas automation delete <id> [--force]
```

### Create

Either fully flag-driven or fully interactive — the CLI prompts for anything you don't pass.

```bash
# Cron trigger
replicas automation create "Nightly typecheck" \
  --prompt "Run \`bun typecheck\` and report any new errors" \
  --environment <env-name-or-id> \
  --trigger-cron "0 4 * * *" \
  --trigger-cron-timezone "America/New_York"

# GitHub trigger (filter to specific repos)
replicas automation create "Review my PRs" \
  --prompt "Leave a code review on this PR" \
  --environment <env-name-or-id> \
  --trigger-github pull_request.opened \
  --trigger-github-repos acme/web,acme/api

# Disable on creation
replicas automation create ... --disabled

# Workspace lifecycle
replicas automation create ... --lifecycle delete_when_done
replicas automation create ... --lifecycle delete_after_inactivity --auto-stop-minutes 30
```

When the user says "make me an automation that...", default to **picking the environment for them by listing the available envs** and asking only when the user hasn't already pinned one. Same for repos in GitHub triggers. Don't pepper the user with questions you can answer by reading the existing config.

### Edit

```bash
replicas automation edit <id> \
  --name "..." \
  --prompt "..." \
  --enabled true|false \
  --environment <env-name-or-id> \
  --trigger-cron "0 4 * * *"   # replaces existing triggers
```

`replicas automation edit <id>` with no flags drops into interactive mode.

## Repositories

Read-only listing of repos connected to the org. Use when the user asks "what repos can I use?", or to validate a `--repository` value before passing it to `environment create` / `automation create`:

```bash
replicas repos
```

Repos are connected via the GitHub integration in the dashboard — not from the CLI. If the user wants a repo connected, point them at the dashboard rather than trying to do it yourself.

## `replicas.json` / `replicas.yaml`

`replicas init` creates a starter config in the current directory. `-y` writes YAML, `-f` overwrites an existing file. This file controls per-repo workspace setup (warm hooks, start hooks, organization scoping for GitHub triggers). When the user asks to "set up Replicas in this repo", run `replicas init` and then edit the generated file based on what they need.

## When NOT to use the CLI

- **Don't use the CLI to reach into other tools' state** (Linear, Slack, GitHub) — those have dedicated skill references in this directory.
- **Don't try to install Replicas, log in, or switch orgs** — those flows are user-facing and aren't available in agent mode anyway.
- **Don't create workspaces** from inside an existing workspace just to run a command. You're already in one.

## Common errors

- `Missing Replicas-Org-Id header` → the workspace is hitting an older monolith that doesn't yet recognize agent auth on this endpoint. Surface this to the user; don't try to work around it by faking headers.
- `Workspace not found` → the workspace was deleted while you were running. Stop and tell the user.
- `An environment with this name already exists` → use `environment edit` instead, or pick a different name.
- `Cannot delete the global environment` → there is exactly one Global env per org and it's permanent. Manage its *contents* (`vars`, `files`) instead.
